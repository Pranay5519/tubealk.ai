This allows you to rebound out of the dopamine trough much more quickly. For example, engaging in a tangential activity that puts your body into a state of discomfort, such as a cold shower or cold immersion, can help.

This could involve pushing through the initial 'limbic friction' to engage in the task you are avoiding for a short period, such as exercising for one to five minutes. If that doesn't work, or you can't get started, engage in a tangential activity that is safe but genuinely feels 'worse' or 'more painful' than your current state, such as a cold shower or cold immersion. This action will steepen the slope of the dopamine trough, allowing you to rebound to your baseline dopamine level more quickly and overcome procrastination.
