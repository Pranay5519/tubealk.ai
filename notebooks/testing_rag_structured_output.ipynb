       "\"definitely (123.36) be able to do amazing things over here (125.36) so quickly I will go ahead and share my (127.6) screen so here you can see that I have (129.599) written this amazing road map to learn (131.52) AI in 2025 (133.76) and here I have you know drawn three (135.84) different routes one is the traditional (139.36) route (142.56) The second one is the modern route and (143.84) the third one is something called as an (146.64) advanced route. Now why do we actually (148.64) require this routes? I will discuss (152.56) about this in a much more detailed (154.8) manner. So let's say uh as I said this (156.48) road map actually incorporates for (160.08) everyone whether you are a fresher (162.8) whether you are an experienced (166.0) professional (167.68) whether you are a leader you are in a (169.76) leadership position and whether you are (172.56) a person who is also coming from a (175.519) complete non-technical background. Okay, (177.92) nontechnical background basically\\n\\ntraditional route wherein you're (379.199) mastering everything like data science, (381.44) machine learning, CV and LP. This will (382.96) definitely be your base and on top of (385.44) that you are adding generative AI and (388.16) agentic AI skills. Okay. Now when I'm (390.24) also talking about generative AI and (394.0) agent AI skills, I'm also talking about (395.28) developing end to-end projects, doing (397.199) the deployment in cloud using some (399.12) amazing LLM ops tools, each and (401.12) everything. Okay. Now coming to the (402.88) second part which is the modern route (405.039) right nowadays if many of the people ask (406.8) me kish (409.6) which path should I probably go ahead (411.52) and take in order to learn AI nowadays I (413.44) usually prefer them modern route. Now (416.319) what is modern route? Here I will say (418.0) them hey go ahead and learn (420.24) generative AI first. (424.0) Okay. So here you go ahead and learn (426.479) about generative AI first. In\\n\\nget into the coding (690.64) industry right coding industry then (692.24) definitely follow this pattern that is (695.6) traditional route then go to modern (697.519) route then go to advanced route now you (698.959) you make the decision you know what is (701.279) basically required see wherever you (703.92) learn something let's say if you are (706.399) going to this modern route some amount (707.76) of knowledge is will be required from (709.12) the traditional route also some basic (710.56) knowledge like NLP, machine learning, (712.56) deep learning, you know, that will (714.32) actually set up your base. But it is not (715.92) like you will be stopping over here. If (718.24) you start with this modern route, you'll (720.8) get blocked somewhere. No, here focus (722.48) more on building applications. Now I (724.959) hope you are able to understand from (727.36) this particular road map how you should (730.0) basically go ahead and do this. If I (731.76) will say if you are a\\n\\nyou are in a (169.76) leadership position and whether you are (172.56) a person who is also coming from a (175.519) complete non-technical background. Okay, (177.92) nontechnical background basically means (181.599) let's say that you may be working in HR, (183.44) you may be working in finance and you (186.879) also specifically want to learn how to (188.959) get into AI, right? So I will also be (191.36) talking about them. So in this actual (193.36) route here you can see this is my first (196.64) path traditional route, second part is (198.64) modern route and the third part is (200.959) advanced route. So let me go ahead and (202.48) fill like if someone was coming to me (204.159) around 2 years back and they were asking (207.68) Kish what should be the road map to (209.68) learn data science I would basically say (211.36) okay go ahead and first learn data (213.92) science first. Okay so here I will go (216.4) ahead and write here you have to learn (218.239) data science first.\\n\\n(613.92) how to build those kind of applications. (615.68) Yes, the basic knowledge of NLP, machine (617.36) learning, deep learning can be asked in (620.16) interviews. But nowadays still in this (621.839) modern route, right? If you go for the (624.399) interviews, they're focusing on building (626.0) generative and agentic application, how (628.079) to make rag, how to perform fine-tuning (630.16) each and everything, right? So they're (632.8) focusing more of this specific (634.399) questions. Okay. Now coming to the third (636.079) route. Okay. Which is the advanced route (638.8) who are really really efficient people. (640.959) You know they can start all three (642.72) parallel. All three parallel (646.079) all three parallel. Now these are those (650.8) people who are already in the technical (652.959) domain and they can quickly learn things (654.399) they can start this three right but (657.12) again the focus must be given in this (658.88) modern route more right whenever\""

       "\"science I would basically say (211.36) okay go ahead and first learn data (213.92) science first. Okay so here I will go (216.4) ahead and write here you have to learn (218.239) data science first. Now what you really (221.68) need to learn in data science. Okay here (224.959) you need to master some amazing things (227.76) like what do you need to master? you (229.84) need to master (232.08) DS that is data science, ML, (233.92) CV, (238.56) NLP. Okay. So here you need to master (240.159) data science, machine learning, computer (243.36) vision, NLP, right? And in all the (244.959) specific topics you should be able to (247.76) understand that stats and linear algebra (250.319) is included a part of it. So in short, (252.959) you're mastering all these technologies (254.959) like data science, machine learning, CV (257.759) and LP. And whenever I'm talking about (259.6) mastering, I'm talking with respect to (261.519) development of a end to-end project. (263.759) Okay. So first of\\n\\n(805.92) three core paths to excellence. Okay. (808.16) And here you can see minimum Python (810.399) 3.11. You can also use 3.9 3. So here (812.88) you have three sections. One is the data (816.16) science and classical AI. Second is (818.56) generative AI. Third is agentic AI. If (820.399) you see path wise data science, NLP, (823.36) computer vision four months I'm taking. (826.639) If you spend two to three hours here, (828.32) you'll be able to definitely become data (830.48) scientist, ML engineer, data analyst. (832.56) Part two is generative LMS. two months (834.72) generative AI engineer, AI product (836.8) developer, agent AI and autonomous (838.48) system, two months a architect, agent (840.399) developer and main thing. This is the (842.24) same route that I have actually (844.48) explained you right now. Okay. Now with (846.24) respect to this, this is my section one. (848.639) I have created a perfect road map to (851.199) learn everything with the free video (853.68)\\n\\nexplained you right now. Okay. Now with (846.24) respect to this, this is my section one. (848.639) I have created a perfect road map to (851.199) learn everything with the free video (853.68) materials and everything itself. Right? (855.76) So here you'll be able to see this (857.6) comprehensive road map covers Python (859.04) programming language stats, machine (860.56) learning, this all you have to do is (861.92) that just go ahead and click this. Okay? (863.6) And if you remember this I have already (865.519) created but I have updated a lot. So (867.44) here you can see work of a data (869.6) scientist data analyst. So first of all (871.199) you need to start with Python (873.12) programming language. All the Python (874.32) programming languages basically over (876.079) here. Then you go ahead with statistics. (877.6) If you start taking the traditional (880.24) route in statistics, I have created very (881.92) detailed videos u in ML 43 videos are (884.56) just there in\\n\\n(1290.72) additional learning resources. (1294.24) See um I'll tell you what is the (1296.559) differences between the free content (1299.039) with respect to the content that is (1300.72) available in the Udemy and live courses (1302.08) also. Okay, as you all know I also sell (1304.159) courses in Udemy in the very affordable (1307.039) cost at 38 3.99. So if you think right (1309.52) you require more help more structured (1313.44) learning then you can just go ahead and (1315.52) follow my Udemy courses. So here I have (1317.12) created another GitHub over here to (1319.76) follow the road map of my Udemy courses. (1322.72) So again based on that track this is (1325.6) much more divided courses like if you (1327.76) want to go ahead and learn mathematics (1329.84) for data science Python with DSA data (1332.0) analyst track data science track (1334.32) generative and engine tracks MLOps and (1336.32) deployment track big data engineering (1339.12) track Figma course track anything\\n\\nthey're saying that hey krish I really (545.04) want to get into AI I also want to start (546.56) coding right so all these things will (548.88) basically be following this modern route (550.88) so it is up to you whether you're in (553.6) experience whether you are 0 to 5 years (555.36) of experience I would still say hey go (557.04) ahead and follow this particular pattern (558.959) right because understand to learn DSML (560.8) CV NLP it will definitely take time if I (563.839) say about this it will actually take (566.72) around 4 months if I talk about geni it (568.72) will take around 2 months only if you (571.36) are devoting around 2 hours daily right (573.68) 2 hours daily so you will definitely be (577.76) able to cover this right here also for (580.0) agentic you may again take 2 months now (582.0) rag and all will come either in genative (585.2) aentic okay Now I hope you are able to (586.959) understand in the modern route because (590.64) we cannot you know right now\""

moment today's discussion (38.76) will also be extremely effective for you (41.12) to be able to study and learn better (43.76) information from say the internet or (46.44) podcasts or any area of your life where (49.239) you are seeking to learn and use new (51.68) knowledge now one of the most important (54.92) things that you're going to learn today (57.079) is that learning that is the best (58.8) learning practices are not intuitive so (60.96) before we dive in keep in mind that (64.839) whatever you believe about how best to (67.439) learn for you is probably Incorrect and (70.2) I confess this was humbling for me as (73.84) well when I started to dive into this (76.04) literature because as somebody who was a (77.64) student for many years and in some sense (80.96) still considers himself a student of (83.04) science and health information because (85.04) of this podcast and certainly somebody (86.479) who still teaches University courses (88.6) both to medical students and graduate (90.68) students and to undergraduate students (92.079) at Stanford I thought I understood the (94.28) whole teaching and learning process but (97.079) I too learned that it is anything but (99.72) intuitive in fact most of what we (101.92) believe about the best ways to study are (104.04) absolutely false fortunately today you (107.24) will learn the best ways to study turns (109.64) out there's a rich literature on this (112.119) dating back well over a hundred years (114.0) and the data are absolutely fascinating (116.0) and Incredibly actionable it's (118.32) incredibly interesting how the fields of (120.039) Education the fields of psychology and (121.92) the fields of Neuroscience have now come (124.28) together to define the optimal (126.52) strategies to study and learn before we (128.64) begin I'd like to emphasize that this (131.84) podcast is separate from my teaching (133.56) research roles at Stanford it is however (135.36) part of my desire and effort to bring (137.64) zero cost to Consumer information about (139.36) science and science related tools to the (141.239) general public in keeping with that (143.28) theme I'd like to thank the sponsors of (145.16) today's podcast our first sponsor is (147.16) eight sleep eight sleep makes Smart (149.519) mattress covers with cooling Heating and (151.599) sleep tracking capacity I've spoken many (153.48) times before on this podcast about the (156.04) critical need to get sleep both enough (158.239) sleep and enough quality sleep now one (160.0) of the key things to getting a great (162.28) night's sleep is that your body (163.56) temperature actually has to drop by (164.84) about 1 to 3° in order for you to fall (166.4) and stay deeply asleep and to wake up (168.959) feeling refreshed your body temperature (171.319) actually has to increase by about 1 to (173.239) 3° one of the best ways to ensure all of (175.28) that happens is to control the (177.8) temperature of your sleeping environment (179.36) and with eight sleep it's very easy to (181.159) do that you program the temperature that (182.92) you want at the beginning middle and the (184.76) end of the night and that's the (186.44) temperature that you're going to sleep (188.0) at and it will track your sleep it tells (189.12) you how much slow wave sleep you're (191.08) getting how much rapid eye movement (192.28) sleep you're getting which is critical (193.92) and all of that also helps you dial in (195.519) the exact parameters you need in order (197.12) to get the best possible night sleep for (199.2) you I've been sleeping on an eights (201.04) Sleep mattress cover for well over three (202.319) years now and it has completely (204.0) transformed my sleep for the better (205.72) eight

Professional Therapy with a licensed (247.04) therapist carried out entirely online (248.68) I've been doing weekly therapy for well (251.48) over 30 years initially I didn't have a (253.04) choice it was a condition of being (255.239) allowed to stay in school but pretty (256.6) soon I realized that therapy is an (258.56) extremely important component to overall (260.32) health in fact I consider doing regular (262.44) therapy just as important as getting (264.479) regular exercise now there are (266.32) essentially three things that great (267.759) therapy Prov provides first of all it (269.199) provides good rapport with somebody that (271.44) you can trust and talk to about the (273.12) issues that are most critical to you (274.919) second of all it can provide support in (277.039) the form of emotional support or (279.08) directed guidance and third expert (280.639) therapy should provide insights with (282.84) better help they make it very easy for (284.56) you to find an expert therapist with (286.039) whom you have these critical components (287.72) of therapy also because better help (289.639) allows for therapy to be done entirely (291.68) online it's very time efficient and easy (293.68) to fit into your busy schedule with no (296.199) commuting to a therapist office or (298.24) looking for parking or sitting in a (299.84) waiting room if you'd like to

by waking up waking up is a (312.639) meditation app that offers hundreds of (315.12) guided meditation programs mindfulness (316.919) trainings yoga NRA sessions and more I (319.039) started practicing meditation when I was (321.919) about 15 years old and it made a (323.6) profound impact on my life and by now (325.8) there are thousands of quality reviewed (328.28) studies that emphasize how useful (330.08) mindfulness meditation can be for (332.12) improving our Focus managing stress and (334.039) anxiety improving our mood and much more (336.12) in recent years I started using the (338.919) waking up app for my meditations because (340.479) I find it to be a terrific resource for (342.479) allowing me to really be consistent with (344.52) my meditation practice many people start (346.28) a meditation practice and experience (348.639) some benefits but many people also have (350.72) challenges keeping up with that practice (352.6) what I and so many other people love (354.8) about the waking up app is that it has a (356.28) lot of different meditations to choose (358.08) from and those meditations are of (359.8) different durations so it makes it very (361.4) easy to keep up with your meditation (363.52) practice both from the perspective of (365.08) novelty you never get tired of those (366.96) meditations there's always something new (368.759) to explore and to learn about yourself (370.16) and about the effectiveness of (372.36) meditation and you can always fit (373.72) meditation into your schedule even if (376.08) you only have two or three minutes per (377.599) day in which to meditate I also really (379.4) like doing Yoga Nidra or what is (381.72) sometimes called non-sleep deep rest for (383.36) about 10 or 20 minutes because it is a (385.36) great way to restore mental and physical (387.639) figger without the tiredness that some (389.68) people experience when they wake up from (391.44) a conventional nap if you'd like to try (392.759) the waking up app please go to waking (394.639) up.com huberman where you can access a (396.52) free 30-day trial again that's waking (399.12) up.com huberman to access a free 30-day (401.639) trial okay let's talk about how best to (404.72) study and learn and of course people (407.319) have different learning styles Some (409.84) people prefer to learn by reading some (411.68) people prefer to study in a group Some (414.039) people prefer to highlight some people (415.68) call themselves auditory Learners other (418.24) people consider themselves visual (420.24) learners but guess what when one looks (422.12) at the research on preferred learning (424.919) styles pretty much all of that melts (427.08) away it turns out that the best way to (429.28) study and learn is defined not by the (431.84) medium in which that material arrives (435.039) whether not it's auditory or visual or (437.639) combined whether or not you review (439.639) slides or a textbook or you watch small (441.479) videos it turns out that the best way to (444.44) study and learn is to access components (447.4) of your memory systems that offset (450.96) forgetting this is a theme I'm going to (454.36) return to over and over again throughout (456.52) today's episode rather than think about (458.16) studying to learn and retain information (460.72) I want you to think about studying to (464.08) offset the natural process of forgetting (466.12) that everybody experiences when they are (469.12) exposed to new material of any kind (471.56) cognitive or motor learning musical (473.919) learning math Etc okay so keep this in (476.68) mind throughout today's episode the best (479.68) way to learn is to think about (481.8) offsetting the natural forgetting of new (483.8) information you're trying to inoculate (486.96) against forgetting that is the way to (489.36) remember things that is the way to gain (491.84) Mastery over them and I'm going to teach (493.56) you how to best do that using the data (496.0) gleaned from the peer- reviewed (500.0) literature now before I do that I want (501.28) to talk about what learning is I promise (503.36) to make this fairly brief because I've (505.84) covered learning and so-called neuro (507.8) plasticity before on this podcast for (509.52) those of you that have heard those (512.32) discussions this will serve as a (513.36) refresher for those of you that have not (514.68) heard those discussions this will be (516.56) thorough enough for you to be able to (518.44) digest all the rest of today's (519.959) information neuroplasticity is this (522.24) incredible feature of your nervous (524.72) system which of course includes your (526.32) brain and your spinal cord which is the (527.519) ability for your nervous system to (530.56) change in response to experience so any (532.32) form of learning involves (535.0) neuroplasticity neuroplasticity we (537.44) sometimes hear as neural plasticity two (540.0) words or (543.0) neuroplasticity those are the same thing (544.32) essentially the change that underlies (546.48) neuroplasticity at the level of cells (548.68) which we call neurons or nerve cells (551.04) generally involves three different (553.36) mechanisms one is the strengthening of (555.48) certain connections what we call (558.279) synaptic connections synapses are the (559.6) location between neurons where they (561.56) communicate with one another it's (564.48) actually a gap between the neurons it is (565.839) technically called the synaptic left (567.959) it's a gap and within that Gap chemicals (569.68) are passed across that Gap that allow (572.44) one neuron to activate other neurons or (574.32) many neurons to activate many other (576.92) neurons or to inhibit the activity of (578.959) other neurons okay so one form of (581.48) neuroplasticity is the strengthening of (584.88) connections between neurons another form (587.399) of neuroplasticity is the weakening of (589.56) connections between neurons and yet a (592.04) third form of plasticity which is often (594.6) discussed in the media but is very rare (596.76) actually in the nervous system (600.16) especially the adult nervous system of (602.12) humans is neurogenesis or the addition (604.279) of new neurons let's just get this out (607.399) of the way up front because the addition (609.56) of new neurons again grabs so much (611.88) attention in media articles but it's (614.16) responsible for a near trivial amount of (616.68) the sort of neuroplasticity that is (619.399) important for today's discussion or (621.0) frankly for most all discussions it is (622.48) true you have a specialized set of (624.839) neurons in your olda factory bulb that (626.32) are responsible for smell as well as a (628.24) specialized set of neurons in the (630.279) so-called dentate gyrus of your (631.6) hippocampus an area of the brain that's (633.12) important for memory in which new (634.92) neurons appear to be added throughout (638.279) the lifespan but this is not the major (640.279) mechanism by which learning and memory (642.399) occurs in humans rather the major (644.279) mechanism by which learning and memory (646.92) occurs in humans is the strengthening of (648.399) existing connections and the weakening (650.72) of existing connections or the formation (652.92) of new connections between already EX (656.399) existing neurons not new neurons okay (659.32) now the removal or weakening of (663.2) connections between neurons being an (665.399) important component of neuroplasticity (667.48) is very important for sake of today's (669.44) discussion I want to emphasize that when (671.16) we hear about weakening of connections (673.279) we often think well that means (675.16) forgetting or that means the brain is (676.92) getting less good however so much of the (679.12) neuroplasticity that underlies for (681.72) instance the acquisition of a new motor (683.68) skill is actually the reflection of (686.079) removal of connections so we don't want (689.32) to project any kind of value onto a (691.72) discussion about adding new connections (694.959) removing new connections let's just (696.76) leave it at this level mechanistically (698.399) when you hear about neuroplasticity just (701.36) know that it could be the consequence of (704.36) strengthening of connections as well as (707.36) weakening of connections and that (710.0) neither strengthening of Connections in (712.68) the nervous system nor weakening of (714.2) connections can map directly to the (716.0) formation or remove removal of say (718.16) memories or information just know that (720.16) these are the important mechanisms in (722.399) fact if you look at a baby that is let's (724.12) say I don't know N9 months old their (727.56) motor skills are not terrific typically (729.72) compared to the motor skills that that (732.279) child will have when they are six or (733.88) seven years old just look at a kid (735.32) trying to eat spaghetti or something of (737.24) that sort or eat anything when they're a (739.639) small baby versus a toddler versus a (741.6) young child versus an adolescent or Te (744.079) You know despite the um poor table (747.079) manners of some adolescence and teens (749.199) and some adults for that matter they are (750.88) still exhibiting far more precise motor (753.959) movements than they did as an infant of (756.76) course and believe it or not the (759.0) Improvement in motor coordination that (762.04) one observes in humans and other species (764.639) for that matter from birth until the (766.639) adolescence and teen years and adult (769.68) years is largely the reflection of the (771.279) removal that's right the removal of (773.8) neural connections as opposed to the (777.36) form (778.88) of neural connections however the neural (779.68) connections that remain become much more (781.839) robust they become much more reliable (783.92) okay so that's the mechanistic backdrop (786.16) for everything that we're going to talk (787.88) about today which is how to study and (789.0) learn and as I mentioned earlier in my (791.639) introduction most of learning and (795.0) remembering new material is about (797.399) offsetting the forgetting process that (799.56) naturally occurs any time we hear new (801.639) information so in keeping with what will (804.199) ultimately reveal itself to be the (807.6) dominant theme of today's discussion (809.56) right now and for reasons that will (812.0) become clear later I want you to take a (813.32) brief quiz now the moment people hear (816.72) quiz or test typically it spikes their (819.44) adrenaline they start feeling stressed (822.12) but don't worry you're going to keep (823.76) your answers to yourself and you're (824.8) doing this for a very specific purpose (827.68) here's my question this is a two (829.399) question (832.04) quiz how many different ways (834.0) mechanistically speaking does does (836.72) neuroplasticity occur is it one (839.56) mechanism two mechanisms or three (842.44) mechanisms or is it four or (844.68) five okay can you name in your head two (848.12) of the three major changes that the (852.8) nervous system can undergo which are (855.44) reflective of (857.88) neuroplasticity okay so the answer to (860.88) question was is that there are three (862.8) different modes of neuroplasticity as (864.759) you recall or as you may not have been (866.92) able to recall and by the way if you (868.839) were not able to recall the three (870.279) different modes of neuroplasticity or (872.279) mechanisms underlying neuroplasticity (874.279) that is fine as you'll soon realize (876.32) recognizing the errors in your (879.36) information retention is another (881.839) critical and very useful way to retain (883.88) more information even if you got the (886.88) answer wrong or you didn't know in fact (888.639) especially if you got the answer wrong (891.68) or you didn't know so the three ways are (893.639) the strengthening of neural connection (897.279) second the weakening of neural (899.48) connections and third through (900.759) neurogenesis the addition of new neurons (902.079) why did I provide this quiz why did I (905.079) test you well as you'll soon learn if (907.0) you look across the total body of (909.68) research on how best to study and learn (911.88) it involves doing exactly what we just (914.399) did which is to periodically stop and (916.32) test yourself on the material that you (919.199) learned testing is not just a way of (921.399) evaluating what knowledge you've (924.56) Acquired and which knowledge you have (926.04) not managed to acquire it also turns out (928.04) to be the best tool for offsetting (931.079) forgetting of any kind and I'll go into (933.8) the data that supports that statement in (935.92) a moment so yes today we're going to get (937.959) a little bit meta in the sense that (939.839) we're going to be learning about optimal (941.12) studying strategies and applying those (943.72) as we go through this podcast and no (945.6) there will not be a test at the end (948.36) although you're welcome to give yourself (950.16) a test at the end I'm going to provide (951.399) you with an excellent zeroc cost very (953.079) fast tool that you can use to evaluate (955.0) your knowledge and your ability to study (957.279) and learn better as a consequence of (959.079) having listened to this podcast versus (961.04) had you not listened to this podcast so (963.88) if ever there was an incentive to listen (965.759) to the end there it is okay let's talk (967.16) about some of the other practical (969.88) aspects of studying and learning I know (971.24) a lot of you out there who want to learn (973.199) and want to come up with the best (975.519) studying strategies are trying to think (976.959) about how to structure your day or how (978.839) much to study or when to study let's get (980.759) the most important things out of the way (983.279) first neuroplasticity and learning that (985.839) is convert converting your studying (988.36) efforts into retention of knowledge is a (989.88) two-step process you probably heard (992.759) about active engagement that's just a (995.279) fancy set of words for focus for really (997.48) attending to the information that you're (1000.44) trying to learn and it is very important (1002.16) anytime you're trying to learn new (1005.24) information so focus goes with alertness (1006.639) you can't be focused if you're not alert (1010.12) this is (1012.399) prerequisite so you need to be alert and (1013.92) you need to be focused in order to pay (1016.88) attention to the information that you're (1019.36) trying to learn in fact it is the (1020.72) process of being focused and (1022.72) attending that cues your nervous system (1024.6) that something is important that (1028.12) something's different about whatever (1029.52) sensory experience you happen to be (1030.919) having when you're focused and attending (1032.52) whether or not it's the information (1034.88) you're hearing or that you're looking at (1035.88) or (1037.48) both that cue at the level of (1038.48) neurochemicals in your brain and body (1041.6) signals to the neurons hey you're going (1044.319) to have to change you're going to have (1046.4) to alter your connections either make (1048.079) them stronger or weaker or a combination (1049.84) of those things in order to make sure (1052.08) that your nervous system can retain and (1054.36) use the information at a future time so (1057.0) that's step one and of course as a part (1059.679) of step one most people when they hear (1061.36) about optimal studying strategies they (1064.28) want to know you know what should they (1066.16) do what should they take in order to (1067.36) learn better well here's what everyone (1069.08) should take in order to learn better (1071.6) which is a great night's sleep the night (1072.96) before limiting your external stress (1074.52) although some stresses good because it (1077.799) cues up your alertness it actually (1079.44) allows you to remember certain things (1081.08) better we'll talk about this a little (1082.76) bit later no one can remove all stress (1083.88) from their life but we know one thing (1086.559) for sure your ability to be alert and (1088.64) focused is going to be greater if you (1091.12) slept well the night before okay so (1092.919) sleep is without question the best neut (1095.24) Tropic right the word neut Tropic means (1097.919) smart drug I don't really like that term (1099.6) because learning involves all sorts of (1101.84) things it's not just about being smart (1103.4) it's about being able to attend it's (1104.84) about sometimes being creative flexible (1106.6) with ideas and information here's the (1108.799) point you're going to need to get your (1111.039) sleep right in order to be able to study (1112.799) and learn at your absolute best and I've (1114.76) done many episodes of The hman Lab (1117.28) podcast about sleep we have a newsletter (1118.96) about sleep that details in a short PDF (1120.6) format the various things you can do to (1123.76) get your sleep optimized so to speak you (1125.52) can find all that hubman lab.com by (1128.08) putting sleep into the search function (1130.0) we don't have time to discuss that (1132.24) material now but get your sleep right so (1133.96) that you can be alert and focused when (1137.08) it comes time to learn now the process (1139.32) of being alert and focused on particular (1142.96) material that you want to learn can be (1144.88) enhanced by just having a silent script (1147.36) within your head silent meaning you're (1150.88) not saying it out loud where when you (1152.4) sit down to learn you're looking at a (1154.96) book or you're listening to a lecture (1156.32) perhaps a podcast like this you're (1158.12) thinking okay I need to learn this I (1160.48) need to learn this you can voluntarily (1161.96) ramp up your level of focus and (1164.559) alertness by telling yourself that (1166.039) information is important (1167.44) don't be a passive participant in (1169.44) learning this is the basis of active (1171.96) learning by expecting the information to (1174.0) be so interesting that it pulls your (1175.919) level of attention and focus out of you (1177.72) rather learn to engage your attention (1179.559) and focus voluntarily (1181.64) volitionally okay when we hear about (1184.52) ADHD attention deficit hyperactivity (1186.88) disorder we know that people with ADHD (1189.32) can attend very rapidly they can really (1192.679) pay close attention for long periods of (1195.84) time if they like a given topic or a (1197.679) given experience or activity they have (1200.4) serious challenges however engaging (1203.84) their attention and alertness if they (1205.88) are not excited about an activity or (1207.919) information and so it is the Hallmark of (1211.039) all good Learners to be able to (1213.6) voluntarily force yourself to attend and (1217.6) to focus and when I say force yourself (1220.32) that means a constant bringing back of (1223.2) your mind's attention to whatever it is (1224.88) you're trying to learn it is meant to (1227.32) feel difficult I say meant to feel (1229.44) difficult because that strain that you (1232.559) feel that encouraging or in some cases (1234.2) forcing yourself to attend sometimes (1236.72) even putting on a hoodie and hat you (1238.28) know literally putting blinders so that (1240.159) you can only attend to the material (1241.64) right in front of you that straining (1243.32) that you feel reflects in part the (1245.919) release of neuromodulators like (1249.12) epinephrine adrenaline in the brain and (1250.799) body which serve to cue the neural (1252.559) circuits that they need to change at a (1254.799) later time okay so the strength that you (1256.679) feel in trying to learn the strain that (1258.96) you feel in forcing yourself to learn (1260.88) how to focus that is good that's a (1262.6) c-tier nervous system that it's going to (1264.799) need to change that neuroplasticity (1266.799) needs to take place think about it if (1269.52) you didn't feel that strain and you were (1272.2) able to perform whatever it is that you (1273.88) were doing or remember whatever (1275.6) information it is that you're being (1277.679) exposed to seamlessly well then your (1278.96) nervous system wouldn't have to change (1281.76) because it already has the capabilities (1283.559) within the neural circuits so that (1285.799) strain that you feel that agitation is (1287.88) great that's a cue that you are learning (1290.64) or that you set the learning process in (1294.36) motion now it's also the case that some (1296.96) people don't have great levels of focus (1299.919) and attention and there are of course (1301.84) pharmacologic tools I would encourage (1304.12) anyone that has clinically diagnosed (1306.32) ADHD to talk to their doctor about (1307.96) whether or not they should use (1309.64) prescription meds and or other methods (1310.559) great sleep is always going to be an (1313.76) important substrate for attention and (1315.2) focus for anybody but especially for (1316.96) people with (1319.279) ADHD I highly encourage anyone that's (1321.48) interested in enhancing their levels of (1324.159) focus and attention to also consider the (1326.159) non-pharmacologic approaches so this is (1329.12) irrespective of whether or not you need (1331.279) pharmacologic approaches yes being well (1332.799) hydrated yes the appropriate amount of (1335.12) caffeine for you that allows you to be (1337.4) alert but not you know shaking and (1338.96) agitated can be very (1341.08) useful however the scientific data also (1342.679) support the fact that doing a brief say (1345.52) five to 10 minute mindfulness meditation (1349.159) each day these are the data from Wendy (1352.4) Suzuki's laboratory at New York (1353.799) University showing that people who do a (1355.799) 10-minute meditation per day where they (1359.12) simply sit or lie down close their eyes (1361.44) focus on their breathing their attention (1363.679) invariably drifts they bring their (1365.679) attention back to their breathing people (1367.2) who do that on a regular basis improve (1369.88) their level of focus they improve their (1372.159) memory and recall ability and of course (1374.159) there are a bunch of other positive (1376.039) effects of that simple (1377.24) zeroc cost tool of mindfulness (1379.08) meditation so if you're interested in (1381.08) improving your levels of focus and (1384.44) attention for sake of learning I highly (1385.919) encourage you to explore the Oho (1388.24) valuable tool of mindfulness meditation (1392.159) just five or 10 minutes per day done on (1395.039) a regular basis you miss a day no big (1397.72) deal just get right back to it the next (1399.32) day does it matter if you do it morning (1400.84) afternoon or night no some people find (1403.52) that doing it too late at night might (1406.4) disrupt their sleep (1407.679) but if you think about meditation of the (1409.039) sort that I just described as a (1410.64) perceptual exercise maybe you don't even (1412.76) call it meditation you're just teaching (1415.12) yourself to focus you could even do it (1416.64) with Eyes Open by focusing on a visual (1418.279) Target allowing yourself to Blink there (1420.2) are good data on this sort of approach (1422.08) as well and then just making sure that (1423.96) your visual attention and cognitive (1426.48) attention comes back to that visual (1428.44) Target over and over again it's a (1430.0) deliberate process of bringing your (1432.12) attention back to a particular (1433.799) location that is very valuable for (1437.0) improving your levels of focus in fact (1439.24) it is known to create significant (1441.76) improvements in your ability to focus (1444.24) which is critical for your ability to (1446.039) study and learn so I know that many (1447.919) people are interested in what to take (1450.08) what to do at the level of kind of um (1452.279) esoteric practices or things to buy (1454.84) there is stuff out there again I (1457.2) mentioned hydration caffeine great sleep (1459.08) and so on but the simple practice of (1461.36) mindfulness meditation or just what I (1463.799) describe as a focusing perceptual (1466.24) exercise of bringing your attention back (1467.96) to the same location over and over again (1469.679) deliberately will train you to train (1471.24) your nervous system to bring your (1473.799) attention back to whatever it is you're (1475.6) trying to learn now I've done other (1477.48) podcasts about how to focus about (1479.24) attention specifically and ADHD again (1481.84) you can find all of those at hubman (1484.08) lab.com simply put ADHD or Focus or (1485.6) tools for focus into the search function (1488.08) and it will take you to the exact (1490.279) timestamps in those episodes that are (1491.679) relevant right now however I want to (1494.2) talk about the second part of (1496.32) neuroplastic (1497.679) which is that the actual changes in the (1499.279) nervous system the strengthening and (1502.24) weakening predominantly of connections (1503.64) between neurons that underly learning do (1506.36) not occur during the focusing and (1508.48) learning or rather the exposure to the (1510.799) material but instead during deep sleep (1512.76) and sleep-like states and again I've (1516.64) done a lot of podcasts and talked a lot (1518.679) about tools for getting better sleep but (1520.159) I just want to remind everybody that the (1521.72) actual reordering of the connections the (1523.799) strengthening of connections between (1525.6) neurons that underly learning the (1526.919) weakening of those connections occurs (1528.36) during sleep in particular during rapid (1530.08) eye movement sleep which tends to (1532.72) predominate in the latter half of the (1534.799) night so make sure that you're getting (1536.799) enough sleep for you for some people (1537.919) it's 6 hours for some people it's eight (1539.559) hours and yes there is something called (1541.039) the first night effect the first night (1542.76) effect is the experimentally observed (1544.64) phenomenon whereby information that you (1548.32) learn on a given day is mostly (1550.679) Consolidated during the night's sleep (1553.36) that you have on that first night after (1555.32) the learning occurs does this mean that (1557.72) if you get a poor night's sleep on the (1559.76) first night after learning something (1561.399) that you are forever going to forget (1562.88) that information that it cannot be (1565.799) Consolidated into your neural circuits (1567.559) no however it's very clear that the (1569.32) first night after learning you want to (1572.559) get the best sleep possible so if you're (1575.2) learning BS you're studying is going (1577.08) late into the night and you're drinking (1579.08) a lot of caffeine be mindful that the (1580.36) sleep that you get after drinking that (1582.279) caffeine late into the day the all (1584.0) nighters that you're pulling those are (1585.96) not serving you're learning well so you (1587.44) need to structure your life as a student (1589.559) of any kind so that you can get focus (1592.12) and attention to what it is you want to (1595.919) learn and you can get sleep to the best (1597.44) of your ability and of course people who (1599.559) are raising young kids or who have (1601.0) stress in their lives for whatever (1603.36) reason perhaps won't be able to optimize (1604.88) their sleep on that first night or even (1607.0) subsequent nights but do your best to (1608.76) get your sleep right it's the single (1610.6) best thing you can do for your mental (1612.44) health for your physical health and for (1614.039) Learning and performance of any kind and (1615.64) it's really worth the effort (1617.88) Now with an understanding of the (1620.84) mechanisms the focus and (1623.2) alertness and the Sleep phase of (1626.279) neuroplasticity what are some other (1630.64) things that you can do to enhance (1632.24) whatever studying and learning you've (1633.88) obtained I already talked about a tool a (1635.799) behavioral tool for enhancing Focus what (1638.08) about a behavioral tool for enhancing (1639.76) plasticity if your sleep is great or (1641.279) especially if your sleep isn't great and (1644.2) there I highly recommend you explore (1645.84) non-sleep deep rest or nsdr there's a (1648.2) script for this in the show note (1650.559) captions nsdr sometimes referred to as (1651.84) Yoga Nidra although those things are (1654.72) similar but different is a 10 or 20 (1656.6) minute practice that you can do to (1659.36) restore your mental and physical Vigor (1661.24) if you haven't slept enough so you could (1663.36) do it first thing in the morning when (1664.559) you wake up if you feel you haven't (1665.679) slept enough you can do it in the (1667.039) afternoon you can do it in the middle of (1668.6) the night if you're not able to sleep (1670.399) and offset some of the Sleep loss that (1672.0) you otherwise would have experienced (1674.039) nsdr is a very powerful tool in order to (1676.64) enhance (1680.279) neuroplasticity and I'll talk more about (1681.399) this in a future episode there's a lot (1683.559) of exciting data coming out about nsdr (1685.039) and yoga Nitra but if you're sleeping (1687.08) well and even if you aren't I highly (1690.2) encourage you to incorporate a 10 or 20 (1692.039) minute nsdr into your schedule someplace (1693.88) again where you place it in your (1697.12) schedule isn't as important as the fact (1698.679) that you do it in order to enhance (1700.48) neuroplasticity that is the reordering (1703.32) of connections between neurons to serve (1705.36) the studying and learning that you're (1707.12) doing now let's talk about how the best (1708.76) students structure their days turns out (1710.88) there are great studies on this there's (1712.96) a really nice paper in fact that (1715.76) surveyed close to 700 students these (1720.44) were medical students approximately (1722.919) equal number of male and female students (1725.36) and analyze the most useful learning (1728.799) habits that is the learning habits (1730.72) associated with the most successful (1732.88) students now anytime you do a study like (1734.6) this where people take surveys there's (1736.799) always the issue of causality in fact we (1738.64) can pretty much set aside any possible (1741.6) causality for instance I'm about to tell (1743.519) you that the very best performing (1745.2) students tend to study for about three (1746.6) or four hours per day but you could (1748.279) easily say Well they're the best (1750.32) students because they study three or (1752.159) four hours per day they don't study (1754.279) three or four hours per day because (1755.919) they're the best students and you'd be (1757.399) exactly right okay we can get into all (1758.64) sorts of discussions about correlation (1760.96) versus causation about reverse causality (1762.559) and on and on however none of that is (1765.399) the point here the point here is to (1767.48) establish what are the habits that the (1769.84) most successful students seem to (1772.08) incorporate over and over again (1774.039) regardless of what classes they're (1775.679) taking regardless of where they are in (1776.96) their Arc of their learning trajectory (1779.24) and so what we know based on this study (1781.519) and I'll provide a link to it in the (1783.44) show note captions is that there are at (1784.559) least 10 study habits that the highly (1787.159) effective students use I'm going to (1789.6) focus on the top five or six just for (1790.919) sake of time because it turns out that (1793.64) most of the effect it appears (1796.32) of being a better student can be (1798.72) attributed to these top five or six (1800.12) habits first of all they set aside time (1802.76) to study they literally schedule time to (1806.279) study now this probably serves several (1808.44) roles the first one is that they are (1810.36) able to clear out other distractions and (1812.679) in fact that's the second thing that (1814.88) they do they are very effective or they (1816.72) make it a point of putting their phone (1819.039) away and off of isolating themselves (1820.64) that's right they're not studying with (1823.72) other people they study alone which is (1825.36) not to say that people who study with (1827.6) others cannot be effective in their (1829.08) studying but the best performing (1830.76) students seem to study alone they put (1832.799) their phone away they tell their friends (1835.24) and families that they are not going to (1838.64) be able to be reached during that time (1840.32) and yes they study for three or four (1843.48) hours per day but they break that up (1845.76) into a couple of different sessions (1847.96) typically two or three sessions so (1849.519) they're not doing a three or four hours (1851.24) studying about all in one (1852.559) shot so they're managing their time (1854.679) they're eliminating distractions and (1858.0) they're studying for a consistent amount (1859.799) of time at least 5 days per week okay (1863.0) presumably they're taking some weekends (1865.96) off although that wasn't made clear from (1867.36) this paper the other thing that they do (1868.76) and this is very important is that they (1870.679) make an effort to then teach their peers (1872.24) to teach other students in the class now (1874.76) some of you may be thinking and I'm (1877.0) thinking back to college here mostly (1878.679) that if you spend all this time learning (1881.2) the information and you are in a (1882.559) competitive scenario with the other (1884.0) students that teaching them the (1885.519) information is kind of kind of a freebie (1887.2) for them and it's harder for you meaning (1888.6) you're putting yourself at a competitive (1890.639) disadvantage or you're giving them an (1892.159) unfair Advantage for not having done the (1893.919) work now while this paper didn't do an (1896.12) analysis of whether or not these (1898.159) students that served as the Learners (1899.279) from the other students got an unfair (1901.559) Advantage it's very clear that students (1903.6) who make it a point to learn material in (1907.039) isolation then bring that material to (1908.88) other students in the same course and (1910.76) teach them perform exceedingly well in (1912.44) comparison to the other students so (1915.279) don't be afraid to be a teacher of your (1917.0) peers in order to test this is key to (1918.96) test and develop Mastery of the material (1922.399) now in my laboratory for years we used (1926.159) to have a saying which I simply picked (1929.0) up from the Laboratories I was trained (1931.12) in I didn't come up with a saying which (1932.6) was watch one do one teach one and that (1933.919) was referring to doing surgeries or (1936.12) suturing or doing an antibody reaction (1938.159) or a western blood or things that you do (1941.039) in (1942.639) Laboratories watch one do one teach one (1944.279) watch one do one teach one of course (1947.399) should be reserved to anything where no (1948.96) one's going to be put in danger by the (1950.399) watch one do one teach one procedure (1952.44) right some procedures especially in (1954.32) Laboratories can be dangerous given the (1955.84) materials you use Etc and of course (1957.96) today we're talking about learning and (1960.399) studying generally so provided it safe (1961.639) watch one do one teach one is an (1964.159) excellent means to learn that is to (1966.0) study new material to develop (1969.44) proficiency and even Mastery and over (1971.159) time perhaps even virtuosity we'll (1973.84) return to that later those distinctions (1976.0) so going back to this idea that the best (1978.96) students set aside time they designate (1980.96) time to study alone without distractions (1983.039) that is sure to help them anchor their (1986.96) focus and attention they know that (1989.039) they're going to need to use their focus (1990.679) and attention during that time and we (1992.44) know with absolute certainty that focus (1994.44) and attention are a limited but (1997.12) renewable resource in the human brain (2000.12) the longer you're awake the more is the (2002.48) buildup of a molecule called adenosine (2004.399) in your brain and body it makes you (2006.399) sleep sley makes it harder to focus when (2007.48) you sleep adenosine levels are pushed (2009.76) down again you're able to focus again (2011.519) you feel more alert you can think of (2013.559) adenosine as limiting your attentional (2015.039) budget which is not to say that some (2017.159) people don't study best in the afternoon (2018.559) or in the evening or even late at night (2020.799) right I recall times during University (2022.88) when I'd study between the hours of 10 (2024.799) p.m. and 2: a.m. I don't do that any (2026.44) longer (2028.44) but scheduling time where you know (2029.48) you're going to need to be focused and (2032.36) attending is perhaps one of the most (2034.2) important things toward being able to (2037.2) focus and attend to the material now if (2039.44) you're taking courses you probably are (2041.44) going to be a slave to the timing of the (2043.84) courses you aren't going to be able to (2045.36) tell the instructor okay listen I want (2046.6) you to do this course at you know 3 p.m. (2048.399) because that's when you learn best or at (2050.599) 8: a.m. because that's when you happen (2052.32) to be able to attend best however to the (2053.76) extent that you have any control over (2056.119) the time in which you're going to study (2057.919) keeping that at a regular time or times (2059.24) perhaps one block early in the day one (2061.879) block later in the day perhaps two (2063.44) blocks early in the day and so on is (2065.32) going to be beneficial it turns out (2067.44) that's also supported by the research (2069.119) literature that the brain just like with (2070.639) its sleep wake cycles that entrain to a (2074.8) regular schedule that is your brain and (2077.879) body get used to being active and (2079.879) inactive at particular times based on (2081.76) your exposure to sunlight your exposure (2084.079) to activities your social rhythms Etc if (2086.119) you regularly meaning for the course of (2088.96) about three days make it a point to (2090.76) focus and study at particular times (2093.72) again pulling your attention back it's (2095.8) not an automatic process but pulling (2097.24) your attention back to a specific (2098.76) location perhaps on a page or that (2101.079) you're listening to in a lecture your (2102.68) body and brain will start to entrain to (2105.079) that Rhythm such that you will be able (2107.92) to focus and attend better simply by (2110.359) virtue of the regularity of the timing (2113.079) of the exposure to the material okay so (2115.839) you probably need about two or three (2118.52) days to break into a regular schedule of (2119.92) focusing and attending and studying at a (2122.359) given time or times allow yourself that (2124.599) transition period but then make it a (2127.88) point to schedule those times to study (2129.8) set aside your phone tell people you're (2132.88) going offline turn off the Wi-Fi if you (2135.28) need to or have to you may need it for (2137.64) your studying I don't know depends on (2139.599) what you're studying but limit (2141.32) distractions at all costs and learn to (2142.92) just focus on the material and this is a (2145.64) skill this is the most important thing (2148.24) to understand it's a skill to be able to (2149.599) focus and study and it's a skill that (2151.68) you can learn very quickly especially if (2153.68) you schedule it for regular times and (2155.88) you give yourself two or three days in (2157.96) which to adapt to those schedules and (2160.24) times and then try and stick to them as (2161.839) regularly as possible perhaps even on (2163.76) the weekends if you're approaching you (2165.599) know the end of the quarter or (2167.28) semester perhaps even on the weekend (2168.96) even if you're not in the quarter or (2172.04) semester keeping those regular times (2173.48) will entrain your nervous system to (2175.64) study and learn at its best at those (2177.8) particular times I'd like to take a (2180.599) quick break and acknowledge our sponsor (2182.4) ag1 by now many of you have heard me say (2184.64) that if I could take Just One supplement (2187.119) that supplement would be ag1 the reason (2188.96) for that is ag1 is the highest quality (2191.4) and most complete of the foundational (2193.52) nutritional supplements available what (2195.16) that means is that it contains not just (2197.359) vitamins and minerals but also (2199.0) probiotics prebiotics and adaptogens to (2200.56) cover any gaps you may have in your diet (2203.48) and provide support for a demanding life (2205.8) for me even if I eat mostly Whole Foods (2208.079) and minimally processed foods which I do (2209.839) for most of my food intake it's very (2211.56) difficult for me to get enough fruits (2213.8) and vegetables vitamins and minerals (2215.0) micronutrients and adaptogens from food (2216.88) alone for that reason I've been taking (2219.44) ag1 daily since 2012 and often twice a (2221.2) day once in the morning or mid morning (2224.359) and again in the afternoon or evening (2226.16) when I do that it clearly bolsters my (2228.079) energy my immune system and my gut (2229.96) microbiome these are all critical to (2232.119) brain function mood physical performance (2234.24) and much more if you'd like to try ag1 (2236.28) you can go to drink a1.com huberman to (2239.0) claim their special offer right now (2242.2) they're giving away five free travel (2243.96) packs plus a year supply of vitamin 3 K2 (2245.48) again that's drink a1.com huberman to (2248.76) claim that special offer before I move (2252.4) into specific ways to study in order to (2254.599) maximally offset forgetting notice I (2258.24) didn't say in order to learn but rather (2260.64) to maximally offset forgetting AKA (2262.8) learning stably learning material (2265.52) there's one other point that I wanted to (2268.079) pass along from this uh really nice (2269.839) study on the study habits of highly (2271.839) effective medical students that I've (2273.4) been referring to and that is when one (2275.2) examined or these people were asked (2278.599) about their motivation for studying the (2281.04) best performing students had an (2284.24) interesting answer they had a very (2286.52) long-term understanding of how or belief (2289.0) rather about how their success in (2292.56) medical school would impact their family (2295.4) how it would impact their life Arc how (2299.319) it would change them and they weren't (2301.16) particular about the ways in which it (2303.24) would change them or their family in (2304.839) fact it was a rather broad abstract (2306.48) aspirational way of thinking about their (2309.2) study efforts so what I like so much (2311.76) about this paper is that you know in (2313.839) addition to having a fairly large sample (2316.599) size close to 700 students that were (2318.52) evaluated and yes it's purely uh you (2320.839) know self-report and this kind of thing (2323.359) nonetheless it Bridges the two extremes (2326.16) of studying and learning you know it (2328.96) gets right down into the nitty-gritty of (2330.56) how long they study when they study the (2332.319) things they do to limit distraction that (2334.359) we just discussed but it also gets to (2336.28) their underlying psychological (2339.319) motivations and the thing that they use (2340.8) in order to pull them forward through (2342.8) their study efforts perhaps especially (2344.319) when their desire is waning or their uh (2346.76) level of fatigue is increasing I don't (2350.52) know that I'm speculating here but this (2352.119) is this aspirational component of going (2354.079) to medical school which it turns out in (2357.64) the country in which the study was done (2359.16) um only very very select few of the very (2361.16) best students are able to achieve that (2364.2) they have to learn the in a different (2366.599) language altogether which is (2368.24) incredible I always Marvel at that you (2370.2) know I have friends that did their PHD (2372.4) thesis in Italy they're Italian by birth (2374.079) they now happen to run a laboratory in (2377.24) Italy and they had to do their PHD (2379.359) training and write papers and give their (2381.88) thesis dissertation and defense in (2383.76) English even though English was their (2386.76) second language so talk about a (2388.28) challenge and um that's just one example (2390.04) that I can think of there are many (2392.52) examples of (2394.64) that these students students that I'm (2395.839) referring to in this study are not (2398.119) necessarily constantly thinking about (2400.72) how their efforts will transform (2403.16) themselves and their families but they (2405.119) certainly were able to report what it (2407.52) was specifically that they are seeking (2409.72) what they're aspiring to besides just (2411.64) trying to do as well as they can getting (2413.96) into and through medical school so the (2416.119) high level aspirational stuff within you (2419.04) whatever that is for you it's going to (2421.96) be highly (2423.44) individual is certainly important and it (2424.44) offers a bookend to the nuts and bolts (2427.96) kind of stuff that you're going to do I (2430.52) would hope in order to best study and (2432.359) learn the specific material so the (2434.119) specific actions that you're going to (2436.28) take each day to learn specific bits of (2437.48) information that will pull you toward (2439.599) those important aspirations and now (2441.839) again if you love the material you're (2443.72) learning this aspirational component is (2445.92) probably not as important right I can (2448.56) recall during University and graduate (2450.319) school and so on thinking oh my goodness (2452.76) this is like the coolest thing I've ever (2455.8) heard probably say that about a million (2456.92) different topics like oh my goodness (2458.599) circadian rhythms seasonal rhythms (2459.88) melatonin neural circuits dopamine I was (2461.599) just a wash with excitement about what I (2463.56) was learning but of course sometimes I (2465.599) would take a course where the material (2467.24) was I don't know if it was more (2468.599) challenging or not but I had a harder (2470.2) time getting engaged by the material (2471.8) either by virtue of how it was being (2474.119) taught to me or the material itself so (2475.56) the ability to attach to some (2478.04) aspirational goal to pull you (2479.599) through can be very valuable you're not (2481.599) going to love every topic you have to (2484.359) learn however I will say that at least (2486.079) in my experience some of the courses (2489.52) that I look back on most fondly are the (2492.04) courses that I struggled with the most (2494.119) and in fact that's the basis of the next (2496.76) and easily one of the most important (2499.599) studying tools so a key theme in all of (2501.839) the excellent literature that is the (2505.4) peer- reviewed research on how best to (2507.4) study is that studying that feels (2509.88) challenging is the most effective I know (2512.28) nobody wants to hear this everyone wants (2515.28) to hear about flow everybody wants to (2517.319) hear about information just sinking into (2519.76) their brain by osmosis I think it was a (2522.0) Garfield cartoon where he talked about (2523.88) learning by osmosis there's this very (2525.56) cute real world video of a kid in a (2527.68) classroom uh I believe uh it's in China (2530.359) where he's taking the book and he puts (2533.24) it on his head maybe I can find this (2534.44) clip and he's just kind of like trying (2535.76) to wash it into his brain it's super (2537.0) cute clip but guess what that doesn't (2538.64) work I mean it works to put the book on (2540.64) your head it doesn't work to it's not (2542.64) going to get the information into your (2543.96) brain uh perhaps someday there will be (2545.319) ways to rapidly download information (2548.359) into neural circuits right now we know (2550.079) we've known for hundreds of not (2553.48) thousands of years that effort is the (2555.359) Cornerstone of learning so I know there (2560.04) probably some gron about that I know (2562.599) some of you perhaps were hoping that (2564.2) today I was going to tell you how to (2565.839) study so that studying wasn't (2567.24) painful I think I can accomplish that by (2569.2) the end of today's episode but in order (2571.88) to do that let's take another quiz okay (2574.44) so here's the quiz again you can answer (2577.28) these questions in your head you don't (2579.0) have to tell anyone but you could write (2580.68) them down or say them out loud if you (2582.52) want the first question (2583.92) is when during either your states of (2587.359) alertness or sleep does the remodeling (2591.559) of neural connections occur I like to (2595.839) think this is a pretty easy one okay the (2598.2) answer is during sleep the second (2600.88) question is what is one behavioral tool (2603.119) that you can use to improve (2607.119) focus the answer is simple mindfulness (2609.92) meditation which I'd prefer you think of (2613.28) Simply as a perceptual exercise so again (2615.119) just sit or lie down close your eyes (2617.0) focus on your breath when your attention (2619.68) drifts bring your attention back to your (2621.04) breath and so on or if you prefer you (2623.8) can do this Eyes Open by focusing on a (2626.52) visual Target either a foot or two feet (2628.359) or 3 ft away whatever distance is (2630.92) comfortable for you allowing yourself to (2632.599) Blink as needed but forcing yourself (2634.76) to focus on that visual Target for say 1 (2637.599) to 3 minutes maybe even 3 to 5 minutes (2640.319) maybe even 10 minutes again please blink (2642.68) you don't want your eyes to dry both (2644.559) those tools will improve your ability to (2646.72) attend to focus to other material when (2648.92) the time comes okay the circuits for (2651.2) focus and attention themselves are (2653.52) subject to (2655.48) neuroplasticity and then the third (2656.839) question is can you name or List off in (2658.52) your mind three tools that the most (2662.52) effective students have been shown to (2665.0) use (2666.599) I can think (2668.72) of limiting distraction by virtue of (2670.04) putting away phones and telling others (2673.119) you won't be in contact with them two (2675.24) and I'm getting these out of order I (2677.599) realize is to isolate to study alone and (2679.52) the third that I can recall is to teach (2682.88) others in the same course okay you can (2687.24) probably think of a few others now why (2690.44) are we taking these silly little quizzes (2693.119) Well turns out they're not so silly when (2695.599) one considers that hopefully you'll (2699.16) remember the information from today so (2700.92) that you don't have to listen to it over (2704.0) and over again but that if ever there (2705.119) was a strongly research supported tool (2708.64) in the literature in the peer-reviewed (2711.68) literature about how students can learn (2713.559) information better it's testing and I (2715.599) know I know I know we think of tests as (2719.64) a way to evaluate our knowledge but it (2722.48) turns out that testing is one of the (2725.28) best ways to build our knowledge to (2726.64) retain our knowledge and again to offset (2728.96) forgetting now the study of testing as a (2731.88) learning tool not just as a way to (2735.079) evaluate how much information we've (2737.44) learned goes back over a hundred years (2739.28) there's a classic study that was done in (2742.0) 1917 where grade school age children (2743.52) read biographies so they read (2747.64) biographies and then the kids were (2750.319) divided into different groups one group (2752.44) read and reread and reread those (2756.4) biographies over and over another group (2758.76) read the biographies once and then were (2762.04) tested on those biographies but get this (2764.559) they tested themselves on those (2768.16) biographies simply by having to think (2769.839) about the information that they had read (2772.88) and trying to remember the information (2775.2) like what was the biography who was the (2777.4) person who are they married to what did (2778.839) they do when did they go to school what (2780.16) did they do in school what did they do (2782.599) in the world what role did they play in (2784.2) life so they essentially tested their (2786.4) own knowledge simply by going into their (2789.319) own head and asking themselves what they (2791.119) could remember about those biographies (2792.76) now keep in mind here that even though (2794.96) it's fairly apparent that reading a (2798.8) biography to three four times might seem (2801.72) more passive than testing oneself on a (2805.04) biography that they had read just (2808.119) once right you could imagine that (2810.28) thinking about the biography involves (2812.72) more effort and indeed it does but keep (2814.4) in mind also that the kids in the second (2817.04) group were only exposed to the biography (2819.0) once and yet when you look at the (2821.119) percent of accurate recall of (2824.44) information from those (2827.4) biographies the children that read the (2828.92) biography once and then made a (2831.079) deliberate point to think about that (2834.48) biography in their own mind to (2836.599) effectively test themselves on that (2838.2) material just within their heads over (2839.68) and over but an equal number of times as (2842.079) the kids that read the biographies (2844.839) directly on a page over and over vastly (2846.96) outperformed the kids that read the (2850.0) biographies over and over put (2851.839) differently reading and rereading (2853.28) material and re re rereading material is (2855.68) far less effective than reading material (2859.4) and then thinking about that material (2862.16) testing yourself on that material (2864.0) forcing yourself to bring that material (2865.599) to mind in your own mind and this is not (2867.2) just for sake of remembering more volume (2870.24) of material but also accuracy of recall (2873.76) of that material and that at least to me (2877.76) was pretty surprising at first until one (2880.04) starts to explore subsequent studies of (2882.48) the role of testing as a learning tool (2885.44) and then you start to realize that (2887.92) testing yourself is Far and Away the (2889.16) best tool for studying and learning not (2892.16) just for evaluating your knowledge but (2894.68) for actually studying and incorporating (2896.839) that knowledge into your neural circuits (2900.2) okay so I realize that anytime I or (2903.2) somebody else talks about a study that (2904.76) was done in 19 17 we think of people in (2906.16) these you know like wooden shoes and um (2908.359) in these School houses that look so (2911.92) different and uh kids dress so different (2913.72) let's get a little more modern here um (2916.4) keep in mind however that the nervous (2918.96) system hasn't really changed much in (2920.68) tens of thousands of years um (2922.839) nonetheless I think it's nice to think (2925.16) about a more recent study of how best to (2926.96) study and this study which by the way (2930.359) we'll provide a link to in the show note (2933.319) captions as well as a couple of reviews (2934.68) that include results from similar (2936.559) studies again I'm pointing to a body of (2938.4) research not just one study (2940.839) here looked (2942.96) at whether or not studying material four (2944.92) times so study study study (2948.04) study was better in terms of locking (2951.64) that information into people's minds (2955.52) allowing them to use that information (2958.0) flexibly which is an element of (2959.72) creativity essentially giving the (2961.28) Mastery of the material then a different (2963.079) Group which studied once studied the (2966.0) material twice studied the material (2968.559) three times then was tested on the (2970.16) material or a third group that studied (2974.24) material once then took one two yes (2978.799) three tests on the material now so what (2983.28) I just described was three groups all of (2985.559) whom read a passage this was a passage (2988.16) about animals about biology some other (2990.4) topics too in different experiments (2993.559) again three groups one group studies (2995.72) four times they study the material 1 2 3 (2997.88) four (3001.079) times then later they take a test the (3001.92) second group studies one two three times (3006.119) takes a test on that material and then (3009.24) later takes a test the third group (3011.96) studies the material once then takes (3014.96) three tests on the material and then (3017.04) later takes a test so what's analyzed (3019.52) and compared between these different (3022.319) groups is their performance on that (3023.72) final test okay what I put in as the (3026.119) fifth bin there right because it was (3029.96) think about it as ssss so study study (3032.599) study study and then later test or SSS T (3035.4) study study study test and then later (3039.319) test or sttt study test test test and (3041.4) then later test so what's compared and (3044.72) contrasted is performance on the test (3046.599) some period of time later now some (3049.16) experiments made that final test of the (3051.68) material a couple days later other (3054.2) experiments made it a couple weeks later (3056.839) other experiments made it much later (3058.92) month or even a year later (3061.119) okay the point here is twofold first of (3063.72) all based on everything I've told you (3067.52) thus far you can probably guess who (3069.76) performed best on the test that occurred (3072.24) some period of time later okay right the (3074.839) performance on that final test was (3080.44) essentially proportional to the number (3084.24) ofest one had already taken on the (3086.079) material okay that should be pretty much (3088.48) obvious given the way we've been going (3090.559) today in this description of tests as a (3092.72) way to offset forgetting okay so the (3095.68) more tests that you (3097.72) take as a way to expose you yourself to (3099.2) the material the better you're going to (3102.359) perform on that material at some later (3104.28) point now of course at some point you (3106.079) have to be exposed to the material for (3107.52) the first time right that's why it's (3108.76) studying and learning but after one (3110.599) exposure to new material taking more (3112.96) tests on that material even if you don't (3114.72) perform that well on those tests as long (3117.0) as you're able to see the accurate (3119.92) answers to those tests and compare your (3121.64) answers to those answers will lead to (3123.599) better performance on the ultimate test (3125.4) and retention of that material at some (3127.68) later time put differently it's not (3129.359) about how many times you study the (3132.799) material or how many times you're (3134.799) exposed to the material it's about being (3136.48) exposed to the material doing your best (3138.92) to focus and attend to that material and (3140.76) then self- testing yourself on that (3143.04) material or as the case may be if an an (3145.2) instructor is the one giving you the (3148.559) test but nonetheless taking tests on (3150.52) that material not just once but ideally (3152.76) two or three times that's what really (3155.88) locks the material into your neural (3158.24) circuits that's what's going to lead to (3160.44) the most pervasive change the most (3162.2) durable change we should say in your (3164.64) neural circuits that carry that material (3167.76) that hold that material in your mind (3170.04) what we call Neural encoding okay so the (3171.48) the more times you test yourself or that (3176.48) you are tested on material the better (3177.88) your retention of that material now some (3179.68) people will immediately say well (3181.88) goodness what if I learned it and then (3183.599) I'm tested and I'm somehow consolidating (3185.799) the wrong or inaccurate material but it (3188.559) doesn't appear to be the case as long as (3190.52) you learn what the correct answers to (3192.319) the tests are even if you're getting you (3194.16) know 40 or 50% or less accurate on those (3196.04) tests that you take immediately after (3199.24) the studying (3200.839) period that's still going to be a better (3202.52) strategy than rereading the material (3204.76) which ought to be somewhat surprising it (3206.88) certainly was surprising to me but you (3209.079) know what's even more surprising and a (3211.48) little scary and that we all should know (3213.079) and I wish I had learned when I was like (3214.839) in the second grade is that if you ask (3216.319) students how confident are you in the (3220.559) material that you just learned how well (3223.0) do you think you would perform on a test (3226.4) what you see consistently in these (3228.68) studies I'm chuckling because it's kind (3231.0) of mindblowing is that the students who (3233.44) study the the material that is who were (3235.92) exposed to the material four times think (3237.64) that they are going to perform best on (3240.52) the ultimate exam however the students (3242.64) that study the material once and then (3245.76) are tested three times on that (3248.04) material they think that ultimately (3251.04) they're going to perform least well for (3254.0) instance they ask them their confidence (3257.079) how well do you think he would perform (3258.4) on a test of this material in two weeks (3259.52) or in a year or in six months or even (3261.76) tomorrow they report that is the (3264.119) students in the study test test test (3266.72) group (3270.0) report much lower confidence in the (3271.0) material much lower sense of Mastery of (3273.319) the material compared to the students (3275.839) that were exposed to the material four (3277.52) times who are saying yeah I think I (3279.28) would do pretty well or very well and (3280.92) guess what the exact opposite is true (3283.52) put differently when you're exposed to (3285.72) material over and over and over again (3287.76) you think you've learned the material in (3289.96) fact your confidence that you've learned (3291.799) the material increases with each (3293.24) subsequent exposure to the material but (3295.44) actually you haven't learned it at all (3298.16) compared to the people that are exposed (3300.4) to the material and then take tests on (3303.24) the material often times straining to (3305.119) get the answers right on those tests in (3307.28) fact sometimes getting those answers (3309.119) dead wrong and then realizing they get (3310.799) those answers dead wrong or sometimes (3313.64) they just sense it but guess what (3315.04) testing yourself once twice maybe three (3317.04) times prior to the ultimate test of your (3319.839) knowledge of that material is Far and (3322.68) Away the best way to lock that material (3325.16) into those neural circuits now I say I (3328.2) wish I had learned this when I was a (3330.72) student because to some extent I used a (3332.039) self- testing approach the one most (3335.24) Salan example of that is I took a course (3338.48) when I was in college I still remember (3340.88) it was bioscience's 169 L neuroanatomy (3343.0) laboratory taught by Ben ree he's still (3346.559) there I believe and he was known then (3349.359) and I'm sure still now if he's still (3352.92) teaching as extremely challenging (3354.799) Professor extremely challenging not as a (3358.599) person not as personality but a ton of (3360.839) detail and rigor and high high high (3363.96) expectation for this laboratory course (3366.599) in neuroanatomy which involved lectures (3368.76) it involved a neuroanatomy textbook (3371.48) where you'd look at you know essentially (3373.359) panels of different brain sections from (3375.0) different species different types of (3376.559) stains of different brain tissue mind (3377.799) you this is an undergraduate course and (3379.839) then there was a laboratory component (3381.799) hence the L in 169 L where you'd have to (3383.16) go from microscope station to microscope (3385.319) station identifying structures based (3387.559) simply on what you could see down the (3391.039) microscope and therefore you had to know (3392.72) what the stain was you know what was (3395.4) essentially visible to you on the slide (3397.28) because certain stains reveal certain (3399.28) things like the what we call the cell (3400.68) body of neurons versus the um the sort (3402.28) of wires what we call the axons between (3404.92) neurons etc etc I remember thinking this (3406.599) is a really hard course it was a very (3409.72) difficult course and my mode of studying (3412.92) for the course involved of course going (3414.839) to class doing the dissection we (3417.76) dissected a sheep brain at that time um (3419.359) so we're literally dissecting an actual (3422.799) brain we're doing microscope work we're (3424.96) learning about it from the textbook and (3427.44) from lecture and there was a ton of new (3428.799) nomenclature about rostral codal dorsal (3431.16) vent all the stuff of neuron anatomy and (3433.24) then at some point I made the decision (3436.88) perhaps on the basis of sheer overwhelm (3439.72) to study for neuron Anatomy by laying (3442.319) down on my bed in my studio apartment I (3446.4) lived alone and closing my eyes and (3449.44) flying through the nervous system from (3453.799) different entry points through the ear (3456.24) review my coar anatomy through the eye (3459.119) review my retinal Anatomy through the (3462.039) dorsal surface of the brain think about (3465.16) the susai and gyri and then the Corpus (3467.28) colossum and then I got and and I can (3469.16) still see it in my mind's eye so my (3470.72) process of studying for neuroanatomy yes (3473.559) involved exposure to the material but it (3476.16) involved hours upon hours of thinking (3478.16) about the material within my own brain (3481.839) so it's a little bit meta unto itself (3486.24) there as a consequence I like to think (3487.88) in fact I believe um with some (3490.68) confidence that I have uh very high (3492.96) Mastery of neuroanatomy in different (3495.76) species as well now that's my particular (3498.0) area of expertise I don't think I'm any (3500.52) kind of savant with respect to neuro (3502.559) Anatomy I just spent hours upon hours (3503.96) learning the material and then reviewing (3505.76) the (3508.0) material within my mind so in other (3508.96) words testing myself here's what I would (3511.079) do if I were moving down a trajectory of (3513.4) a of a neural tract for instance between (3516.0) say the the hippocampus and a (3518.92) neighboring structure and I didn't know (3520.76) what was next I would then go look it up (3522.079) in the textbook and then I'd go back to (3524.16) this you know mental exercise (3525.599) visualization type studying it really (3527.52) wasn't studying is the point the point (3529.72) is that I was testing myself I was (3532.2) trying to find the points in which I no (3534.319) longer had the knowledge to move further (3536.52) through in this case my mental image of (3539.28) the brain but through the material and (3541.119) this is the key aspect of testing it's (3543.52) not about just knowing how many things (3546.039) you get right how many things you get (3548.839) wrong it's about recognizing exactly (3550.2) what you know and don't know and an (3552.4) important component of testing is (3554.599) running up against those things where (3556.4) you say h i can't remember I don't know (3557.92) what comes next or I'm certain that that (3560.319) structure is the fimbria and then you go (3562.4) and you look and you go it's not the (3564.359) fima but guess what I'll never forget (3565.72) for instance the location of the (3568.599) habenula or what it looks like a (3570.48) structure which by the way since these (3572.64) names are kind of uh esoteric at that (3574.24) time we didn't know what it does it (3576.359) turns out it's involved in (3577.359) disappointment it's key to the (3579.0) depression circuits or the circuits that (3580.72) underly depression in some individuals (3582.2) it is um suppressed by viewing of (3584.559) morning sunlight we know that too and by (3587.039) getting too much artificial light (3589.48) exposure in the middle of the night you (3591.0) enhance activity of the habenula (3592.48) beautiful work not done by my laboratory (3594.68) but other Laboratories demonstrates that (3596.559) so what I just did for you there was (3599.4) hopefully teach you a little something (3601.64) about neuron anatomy and depression but (3602.72) more importantly to just illustrate that (3605.0) how you test yourself can be highly (3607.44) individual to the ways in which you (3609.2) learn best now that contradicts what I (3611.799) said earlier which is that this notion (3613.76) that people have different learning (3615.88) styles and you know some people are (3616.96) verbal Learners and some people are (3618.16) auditory Learners and Etc doesn't really (3620.0) hold up so well anymore but which by the (3622.96) way is not to say there isn't any (3626.64) research to support it it's just that (3627.92) it's heavily contradicted by other (3629.64) research that contradicts that idea but (3631.039) your approach your mode of best testing (3634.559) yourself on material for sake of (3637.96) offsetting the forgetting process and (3639.839) for identifying where you have gaps in (3641.68) your knowledge or where you thought you (3643.799) knew something but you don't or you knew (3645.2) something but it's wrong that can be (3647.0) accomplished through the approach that's (3649.559) best for you which in my case turned out (3652.039) to be lying down and thinking about the (3653.599) material in my head head and still to (3655.2) this day when I read a paper I try I (3657.0) don't always do this but what I try to (3660.4) do is then take a walk in my yard or (3661.92) outside and I try and think about the (3663.599) key components of that paper and think (3665.28) about some of the graphs that are (3667.079) especially important which is what I'm (3668.319) going to do now I'd like to take a brief (3670.2) break to thank one of our sponsors (3672.039) element element is an electrolyte drink (3673.72) that has everything you need and nothing (3676.039) you don't that means the electrolytes (3677.68) sodium magnesium and pottassium in the (3679.359) correct ratios but no sugar now I and (3681.88) others on the podcast have talked a a (3684.559) lot about the critical importance of (3686.0) hydration for proper brain and bodily (3687.4) function research shows that even a (3689.72) slight degree of dehydration can really (3691.48) diminish cognitive and physical (3693.52) performance it's also important that you (3695.319) get adequate electrolytes in order for (3697.0) your body and brain to function at their (3698.799) best the electrolytes sodium magnesium (3700.4) and potassium are critical for the (3702.92) functioning of all the cells in your (3704.599) body especially your neurons or nerve (3705.92) cells to make sure that I'm getting (3707.72) proper amounts of hydration and (3709.079) electrolytes I dissolve one packet of (3710.319) element in about 16 to 32 ounces of (3712.319) water when I wake up in the morning and (3714.4) I drink that basically first thing in (3716.039) the morning I also drink element (3717.599) dissolved in water during any kind of (3719.359) physical exercise I'm doing especially (3720.799) on hot days if I'm sweating a lot and (3722.68) losing water and electrolytes if you'd (3724.559) like to try element you can go to drink (3726.72) element.com huberman spelled drink (3728.559) lm.com huberman to claim a free element (3731.64) sample pack with the purchase of any (3735.24) element drink mix again that's drink (3736.92) element.com huberman to claim a free (3739.24) sample pack okay so I like to think that (3742.039) we're establishing that testing yourself (3744.0) or testing your students or being tested (3745.599) by your teacher is the best way to (3748.72) offset (3752.119) forgetting let's look at the literature (3753.44) that actually supports that statement (3755.559) directly because in the previous (3757.319) experiment I described it was either (3759.079) study study study study or study study (3760.44) study test or study test test test and (3763.039) then later everybody takes a test at the (3765.24) same time a variant on that was done (3766.76) where they had one group of (3770.52) students study material so this is new (3772.44) material and when I say study I mean (3775.039) they were exposed to the material for (3777.279) the first (3778.68) time and I realize this is a little bit (3779.599) of a problem because we're using the (3781.92) word study when in fact I'm trying to (3783.599) make the point that testing yourself is (3785.76) studying okay so uh forgive me but this (3787.48) is the way it's mapped out in these (3790.359) experiments in these papers should you (3791.88) look them up in our show note (3793.319) captions one group is exposed to the (3795.72) material what we're call studying and (3798.72) then takes a test immediately after they (3800.48) are told what they got right what they (3803.319) got wrong on that test and what the (3805.079) correct answers are and then sometime (3806.44) later after a delay they take a test of (3808.76) the same material another group studies (3812.44) that is they're exposed to the material (3815.799) then there's a delay okay that delay (3817.359) could be days it could be weeks this (3819.72) experiment has been done every which way (3822.119) it seems by now then they're tested and (3824.48) then there's another delay and then they (3828.279) take a test at the same time that group (3830.44) one did okay so again it's study test (3833.2) long delay test for group one or study (3836.68) delay test delay test for group two (3839.76) remember the final test is taken at the (3843.319) same time by everybody or group three (3844.68) study that is they're exposed to the (3848.119) material then a long long long long long (3850.0) delay then a test and then the ultimate (3851.799) test okay the test that everybody takes (3854.76) at the same time can you guess which (3856.92) group performed best and the essence of (3859.76) this experiment if you're listening to (3862.119) this and it's not clear in your mind is (3863.48) you're either expose to the material and (3865.039) test it very soon after and then take a (3867.0) test after a delay say a week or two (3869.0) weeks later or you're exposed the (3871.599) material there's a delay of a few days (3874.039) then you take a test and then another (3876.599) few days and then you take a test so (3878.2) it's more evenly spaced or if you were (3879.44) assigned to the third group you'd study (3882.119) you're not going to see the material or (3884.079) be tested on it until a day or two (3885.76) before the big test then you're tested (3888.079) on it you get your answers back and then (3890.039) you're tested on it again you could (3891.4) imagine that the last group might (3892.88) perform best because they're reexposed (3894.559) to the material they're told what the (3896.799) correct answers are so they know what (3898.2) they got wrong they know what they got (3899.799) right and then the next day they're (3901.52) taking the test again I would have (3903.24) thought that group would perform best (3904.96) but it turns out the opposite is true (3907.0) it's pretty wild the best performance (3909.68) comes from being exposed to material (3912.279) what in this experiment they're called (3914.44) studying okay so they read a passage or (3915.72) they learn some math material or (3918.24) language material or music material or (3919.68) motor (3921.72) learning then they take a test very soon (3922.68) after even same day or next day and then (3925.0) there's a long delay and then they take (3927.119) the test that group performs best put (3929.079) differently test yourself very soon if (3931.64) not the same day certainly the next day (3935.119) or so very soon after being exposed to (3937.079) material for the first time as opposed (3939.64) to the last group which performs worst (3942.279) they perform worse being exposed to (3945.039) material then there's a long period of (3946.88) time then you're tested on that material (3948.52) you are told what you got right what you (3950.599) got wrong and then the next day you take (3952.44) a test again even with overlapping (3953.88) questions to the test you took just the (3956.92) day before and that group performs worst (3958.44) and the group that studied had a gap (3960.64) test that had a gap test they performed (3963.319) somewhere in the middle what does this (3965.319) tell us what it tells us is so important (3967.0) Visa neuroplasticity Vis of V best (3969.96) learning strategies this is something (3971.92) that goodness I wish I had learned when (3973.72) I was in graduate school when I was an (3976.599) undergraduate when I was in high school (3980.079) and Elementary School goodness even when (3982.0) I was in kindergarten I wish IID learned (3984.48) this test yourself on the material that (3987.559) you were just exposed to very soon after (3990.039) your first exposure to it (3992.52) because that offsets the natural (3995.68) forgetting of new material that the (3998.799) brain is exposed to this is absolutely (4000.839) the Hallmark of all the impressive data (4004.2) about testing as a tool for learning (4007.359) testing oneself or your students or (4010.92) being tested if you're the student by (4013.52) your teacher (4015.119) as a tool not just for evaluating (4016.92) performance for knowing what you know (4019.44) and don't know but for consolidating (4021.039) that information in your neural circuits (4023.92) and when I say consolidating that (4026.599) information in your neural circuits I (4028.119) realize it's a (4029.64) mouthful what we know is that this (4030.76) business of putting the testing soon (4034.359) after exposure to new material is about (4036.0) offsetting the forgetting of that (4038.559) material so you might say wait if that's (4040.44) true how come studying the material and (4043.279) then waiting and then then taking two (4044.839) tests right back to back where you're (4046.039) learning the material again during the (4047.48) test that should be the best performing (4048.88) group ah well there seems to be (4050.48) something fundamentally different about (4052.359) first exposure to material versus (4054.559) testing yourself on that material and we (4057.599) don't know exactly what that is there's (4059.4) some interesting neural Imaging data in (4061.279) humans that this has to do something (4063.52) with this notion of familiarity with (4066.599) material this is very simple so this is (4069.079) easy to understand even though it (4071.119) involves a little bit of memory (4072.2) Neuroscience nomenclature (4073.799) familiarity with something recognizing (4076.799) it is not the same thing as having (4079.4) agility with that thing of having (4082.279) Mastery of that thing is not the same (4084.0) thing as having Mastery of the material (4086.24) of having committed it to memory okay so (4087.96) when you read something over and over (4090.88) and over you see it over and over you (4092.48) hear it over and over you think about it (4095.319) over and over of course you're reading (4096.839) it or you're hearing about it and you (4098.279) think that you're learning the material (4100.719) that your neural circuits are changing (4102.719) but it's a pretty passive process or (4104.88) even if it's a difficult chapter to read (4106.679) or a difficult passage of (4108.839) Music the difference is when you're (4112.04) tested on material something happens in (4114.08) your performance of or recalling of if (4117.4) it's just you know cognitive or you're (4120.4) writing it down or you're told to play (4121.88) the the music or do the the motor (4123.839) movement something happens in the error (4125.96) the getting wrong of certain things that (4128.719) cues your nervous system to lock in the (4131.359) information that you have right and to (4133.719) remember what you have wrong so that you (4136.199) then correct it which is Far and Away (4138.04) different than exposure and reexposure (4139.88) and reexposure okay so it's a (4143.92) prerequisite to learning that you need (4146.199) to see the material for the first time (4147.719) you can't just start testing yourself on (4149.6) material you've never been exposed to I (4150.839) suppose you could but you're going to (4152.52) get it I would imagine mostly wrong or (4154.12) all wrong but this business of using (4156.759) testing very soon after first exposure (4160.159) to material as a tool to study (4162.199) in order to offset forgetting is clearly (4166.08) tapping into this difference between (4168.279) familiarity with something for which we (4170.08) know certain brain areas are activated (4172.359) versus recollection being able to take (4176.679) that material and bring it to memory (4179.56) bring it to your focused attention and (4182.12) use that material I realize this is a (4183.92) bit abstract and some of this is still (4186.0) being parsed if you're interested in the (4187.52) Neuroscience of familiarity with (4189.199) something versus your ability to (4191.239) actually recall something and have (4192.6) Mastery of that material (4194.4) there's a really nice review that I (4196.4) provide a link to in the show note (4198.92) caption it's published in the journal (4200.44) hippocampus I always chuckle at the fact (4202.159) that there's a journal that named after (4204.12) a brain structure after all as far as I (4205.6) know there isn't a journal called retina (4207.44) or amydala um and I have a brief (4209.719) anecdote from graduate school whereby I (4211.96) learned that there was this journal (4214.76) hippocampus and I was at a graduate it (4216.44) was my first graduate student gathering (4218.92) in graduate school and the guy who (4221.36) hosted it um turns out is AUM AR in the (4222.92) field of learning and memory and I was (4225.92) saying you know this is ridiculous like (4228.28) there's a journal called hippocampus (4229.8) here I am first year graduate student he (4231.4) goes yeah there is and I said yeah (4233.48) that's so silly like who are the who are (4234.8) the like who are the idiots that name a (4236.64) journal after a brain structure turns (4238.96) out there's also a journal called (4241.04) cerebral cortex and there's probably one (4242.08) about spinal cord so it turns out I I (4243.84) was the idiot saying this and the guy I (4245.44) was talking to who of course was the (4247.239) host of the party said yeah actually uh (4249.12) that's my journal I founded the journal (4251.12) hippoc campus so you can look them up so (4252.64) at this Point you're going to take a (4254.88) test and it's a super easy test okay I (4256.48) realize we're a bit into the material (4258.96) and we're all probably fatiguing a (4261.0) little bit marveling I hope at what an (4263.08) incredible tool testing and in (4265.64) particular self- testing soon after (4267.8) being exposed to new material is and the (4269.76) question is this and by the way this is (4272.36) an open-ended question you're not (4274.52) supposed to know the answer because I (4276.8) haven't told you the answer yet but I (4278.04) want you to think about (4279.64) this if one looks at the majority of (4282.12) data in this whole field of testing as a (4285.32) studying (4288.44) tool how much improvement do you think (4289.92) you get from testing yourself once on (4292.48) new material do you think it's a you (4295.12) know 10% Improvement a 20% Improvement (4298.08) so here I'm just comparing to testing (4300.96) yourself once on material that you were (4302.28) just exposed to For the First Time (4304.76) versus not testing yourself at all okay (4306.28) how how much do you think you improve (4309.04) the answer is about 50% 5 zero and I can (4311.32) say that on the basis of the fact (4316.36) that in studies of musical learning of (4318.96) mathematical learning of language (4321.48) learning of motor learning when subjects (4322.92) are exposed to new material and then (4325.199) tested at some period of time later the (4326.88) percentage of information they get right (4330.199) or that they are able to perform (4332.48) something correctly diminishes over time (4335.36) especially because they're not doing any (4338.92) practice and no testing in the (4340.92) intervening time this was built into (4342.719) these experiments (4344.6) and then you simply ask how much of the (4346.0) material was (4347.92) forgotten if they just were exposed to (4349.199) the material so in the case of say music (4351.92) learning this would be you know your (4354.6) teacher sits down next to you and shows (4355.84) you the scales on the piano but then (4357.639) you're not practicing them in between (4360.0) versus um or perhaps another example (4361.56) would be somebody gives you a lecture (4364.28) about a particular phase in history and (4365.639) then you're not being exposed to the (4367.96) material again and you're not self- (4369.639) testing versus if you just take one test (4370.88) even a self-directed test of the (4373.96) material immediately after irrespective (4375.679) of how well you perform you have the (4377.88) amount of forgetting okay I want you to (4380.48) think about self testing in this way (4382.84) because we're thinking about optimal (4385.4) studying strategies you have the amount (4387.12) of forgetting that would normally occur (4390.0) this is oh so important in fact I don't (4392.36) even know that most neuroscientists (4394.199) think about learning and neuroplasticity (4395.92) this way most everybody including (4398.08) neuroscientists are taught we taught (4400.8) continue to be taught that you're (4403.32) exposed to new material you focus okay (4405.12) then during sleep there's remodeling of (4406.84) the connections all that's true but we (4408.159) really need to think about how most (4410.92) information that comes into our nervous (4413.159) system each day is forgotten most of it (4414.56) is completely discarded there are some (4417.48) rare clinical deficits where people (4419.44) remember everything and I'll tell you (4422.199) these people really struggle in life (4423.92) they do not do well in work in (4426.159) relationships they remember every little (4428.76) detail of everything and it is (4431.08) incredibly disruptive to their quality (4432.88) of life it's nothing you want you want (4435.719) to have a great memory for the right (4437.8) things so when you self test material (4439.679) you have the amount of forgetting that (4444.08) occurs compared to if you're just (4446.32) exposed to the material I want you to (4448.44) keep that fact in mind because that fact (4450.36) is the one that really hit me upside the (4453.159) head and made me realize goodness (4455.4) gracious how I wish that I'd self- (4457.719) tested myself on material that I wanted (4460.4) to remember over time rather than (4462.679) reading it over and over I had this (4465.08) elaborate process for studying that I (4466.719) used all through college and graduate (4468.44) school and it worked pretty well for me (4469.8) where I'd read and highlight then I'd (4471.36) write out my notes then I would write (4473.04) little paragraphs about that stuff now (4474.56) some of that probably mimicked self- (4476.08) testing indeed it had to have and then (4478.159) of course I would take the quizzes and I (4480.56) would go to office hours you know once I (4481.96) got serious about school I got really (4483.679) serious about school and of course I (4485.12) still forget things I've made errors on (4486.32) this podcast before apart from going too (4488.239) fast or making a joke that people didn't (4490.56) perceive as a joke a whole story there (4492.32) but in any case of course I make errors (4494.52) of course I've forgotten certain things (4496.32) and sometimes I misspeak I always strive (4498.199) to get things accurately we correct (4500.8) things in the show note captions if (4502.48) they're called out to us we're now using (4503.88) AI to review the podcast and adjust (4505.32) anywhere using insertion so actually (4508.04) replacing those words if we need to and (4510.08) so on and so forth but yes we all forget (4512.28) things we all make errors but if I had (4514.8) just known that testing myself on (4518.04) material while walking out of class or (4520.92) soon after getting home or later that (4523.159) evening or the next day would allow me (4524.6) to perform so much better on an exam a (4527.04) midterm or a final exam and of course I (4530.8) still would have studied because I was (4533.12) committed and you should still study as (4534.32) much as you feel is necessary to get (4535.8) Mastery of the material for (4537.679) you however if I had known that testing (4539.84) oneself or being tested soon after (4543.12) exposure to material would have the (4544.92) amount of forgetting even out to a year (4546.92) later I definitely would have saved (4548.92) myself a lot of time let's talk about (4551.159) some specifics of ways that you can self (4553.8) test or if you're a teacher or if you (4555.92) have good dialogue with your teacher and (4557.84) they are open-minded perhaps they are (4559.6) open to hearing about what are the best (4561.8) forms of testing oneself as a tool for (4563.719) learning the best tests are open-ended (4568.76) short (4573.719) answer very minimal prompt tests not (4574.84) unlike the type that we've taken today (4578.32) during this podcast as compared to (4580.32) multiple choice tests multiple choice (4583.48) questions allow for familiarity of names (4585.719) of facts you know it's going to be a b c (4588.96) d and sometimes e is you know A and C (4591.639) and so on and so forth and within each (4595.199) of those a b CDE e answers and you're (4597.6) looking for the right answer you're (4600.239) looking for the familiarity the (4601.52) recognition of something yes this not (4603.08) that okay that's the best answer you (4605.159) Circle C okay this kind of thing as (4606.48) opposed to an open-ended question where (4609.44) you have to write out your answer you (4611.12) have to recall the information right it (4612.679) requires a much greater degree of (4615.84) Mastery of the information than does (4617.88) familiarity or recognition of the (4620.52) material so the best tests as study (4623.04) tools are going to be open-ended short (4626.159) answer questions or even long answer (4629.4) questions now there's one exception to (4631.12) this which are multiple choice tests (4633.36) that include tricks okay if you've ever (4636.0) taken the GRE the graduate school (4638.36) entrance exam or the elsat or the MCAT (4640.44) there are some questions in there that (4644.56) are very straightforward but in those (4645.96) standardized tests they tend to include (4647.88) some quote unquote trick questions in (4650.6) which those questions don't allow you to (4653.08) just recognize the correct answer and (4655.239) distinguish it from the other incorrect (4657.239) answers but rather they have answers in (4659.48) there that on first blush look like the (4662.48) right answer and people have a tendency (4665.32) to Circle those and move on or to select (4666.88) those and move on but if you think about (4669.679) the material a little more deeply turns (4672.12) out those quote unquote obvious answers (4674.36) are actually the incorrect answers so (4676.96) there are versions of multiple choice (4679.44) tests where it requires a greater degree (4681.159) of Mastery of the material where simple (4684.719) familiarity won't serve you and you (4686.8) actually have to be able to recall the (4688.639) different components of information (4690.44) leading into that but those are a bit (4692.12) more rare certainly in the context of (4694.4) other kinds of learning like musical (4697.08) learning although I suppose for music (4699.0) theory that could be relevant but when I (4700.679) say Music Learning I'm just kind of (4702.8) fating to the idea of the mechanics of (4704.8) musical learning but of course there's (4706.4) music theory Etc so what I'm effectively (4707.76) saying is the ultimate exam the final (4711.199) exam the midterm exam the exam that's (4713.44) administered to you rarely do you have (4715.48) control over the format of that exam (4717.239) sometimes it's mixed format but the (4719.36) different ways in which you self- test (4721.639) as a form of studying are really key and (4723.28) ideally you would make these open-ended (4726.04) in other words you would not simply rely (4729.04) on multiple choice you would rely on a (4731.28) form of self- testing or that you give (4734.8) your students or that your teacher gives (4736.56) you that requires you to think about the (4738.0) material with some degree of depth with (4740.0) some degree of effort and of course (4742.159) you're going to get certain things wrong (4743.719) now I would hope that if testing is (4745.36) being used as a learning tool as opposed (4746.76) to just for evaluation but here we're (4749.36) talking about using testing as a (4752.12) learning tool that it wouldn't impact at (4754.32) least not at that moment your final (4757.88) performance in the course or whatever it (4760.32) is rather it is testing for sake of (4762.04) learning learning now we know from the (4764.4) literature that students don't like pop (4766.6) quizzes I gave you a few today and (4770.04) forgive me they don't like pop quizzes (4772.239) and we know this in the form of the (4774.28) reduction in teaching evaluation scores (4777.08) okay uh having received teaching (4779.88) evaluation scores of different uh let's (4781.48) say values over the years and I always (4784.159) take the feedback (4786.04) seriously one Salient comment that just (4788.56) leapt into my mind was the fact that I (4790.84) end up mentioning my Bulldog Costello (4792.4) too often in class so here I'm (4794.76) mentioning him again just to get back at (4796.6) that one student that said I mention too (4798.239) much I'll mention him as much as I want (4799.84) the point here is that when students (4801.719) evaluate their teachers they tend to (4804.639) punish their teachers for pop quizzes (4806.92) does that mean pop quizzes aren't (4809.84) effective no but you know what's more (4811.239) effective telling students at the outset (4812.84) of class or telling yourself at the (4814.88) outset of any kind of learning (4816.48) Expedition because this isn't just about (4819.28) the classroom that you're going to take (4821.679) a bunch of exams that you're going to (4823.52) use testing or quizzes whatever you want (4825.08) to call them as a form of teaching and (4827.8) learning and that you can expect five (4830.96) tests or five quizzes during the course (4833.32) of being presented the material or that (4836.199) you are going to test yourself every day (4838.56) after the material now sometimes you (4840.199) have to go from one class to the next (4841.56) class there isn't an opportunity to test (4843.04) yourself but guess what's not going to (4844.6) be helpful walking out of class and (4846.08) getting immediately on to your phone we (4847.719) know that that probably inhibits your (4849.84) ability to remember the material because (4851.48) it's going to enhance forgetting because (4853.4) you do have this key (4855.28) opportunity right after being exposed to (4856.96) new material to help offset the (4859.199) forgetting by testing yourself on that (4861.199) material as soon as possible after being (4863.12) exposed to it so again even though I did (4865.36) not attend school in an era where we had (4868.96) smartphones and texting I recall walking (4871.12) out of class and just walking out of (4873.8) class and going to my bicycle but of (4876.04) course there were people to talk to (4880.08) there were other things to attend to if (4881.56) you're really serious about learning (4883.4) material take a few seconds maybe even a (4884.84) few minutes after being exposed to that (4887.239) material and think about that material (4888.8) test yourself on it and if you find that (4890.48) you don't know the material you're (4892.8) confused by it or overwhelmed by it (4894.36) great you just accomplished the first (4896.32) step in queuing your nervous system to (4898.639) the fact that it needs to learn that (4900.239) material and you've created an (4902.28) opportunity for enhanced neuroplasticity (4903.96) which is really what all of the stuff (4906.56) about testing as a form of studying is (4908.239) about you're going to test yourself so (4910.28) that you figure out what you don't know (4912.76) so that you then look up that material (4915.04) test yourself on it again so that (4916.84) ultimately you (4919.159) forget very little of it if any now (4920.719) there are other components to learning (4923.8) and neuroplasticity that I've talked (4925.12) about on previous podcast that are just (4926.6) too interesting not to mention but I'm (4928.159) just going to mention them in brief (4929.6) things like Gap effects Gap effects are (4931.0) oh so cool and they've been demonstrated (4933.76) for lots of different forms of learning (4935.44) Gap effects (4937.239) are what I just did which is to take (4938.56) periodic pauses in the learning of (4941.719) material as short as 5 to 10 seconds but (4944.56) even as long as 30 seconds during which (4947.159) guess what your hippocampus the neurons (4949.719) in your hippocampus repeat information (4951.96) that you've been exposed to for the (4954.48) first time at a rate 20 to 30 times (4955.88) faster than (4959.36) typical just as it does during rapid ey (4961.0) movement sleep so if you are a teacher (4964.08) and or if you are a (4966.76) learner periodically throughout an (4969.0) episode a class or whatever of trying to (4972.04) learn new motor skills or music skills (4973.96) or whatever kind of (4975.8) learning pause and let your hippocampus (4977.56) generate more repetitions of that (4981.32) material than it would otherwise if you (4982.96) just tried to Barrel through so I (4984.88) realize as we've gone through today's (4986.56) discussion that words like test and quiz (4988.239) evaluation offsetting forgetting all of (4991.639) that stuff can you know Spike people's (4993.92) cortisol it can uh give us flashbacks to (4996.08) uncomfortable classroom experiences (4999.08) related to being called on cold called (5000.92) uh for the answer um a vicious trick (5003.88) that instructors play keep in mind that (5006.28) testing as a form of studying whether or (5008.84) not self-directed or given to you by a (5010.679) teacher is not for sake of evaluation at (5013.199) the level of okay you know you get an (5016.32) exam at the end of a lecture and then (5019.56) you do your best to answer those (5022.28) questions and then you turn it in and it (5023.88) impacts your grade no this is (5026.12) about being told or revealing to (5028.48) yourself how much you know and don't (5031.48) know and then of course being told the (5033.199) correct answers so that you can compare (5034.88) your answers to the correct answers and (5036.639) doing this frequently and ideally very (5038.4) soon after being exposed to the material (5040.679) that's one of the key things that I keep (5042.56) coming back to again and again here um (5044.639) because it's something that frankly was (5047.76) not done well I was in school um for (5049.239) whatever reason and I think that's (5052.28) largely because when people hear the (5054.08) word testing they think of evaluation (5055.88) and if anything at least in the United (5058.4) States over the last 30 years but in (5060.4) particular over the last 15 years (5062.639) there's been this tendency to shift away (5064.679) from formal evaluation you know I (5066.48) personally believe that one can learn in (5068.719) many different styles and many different (5070.92) contexts I of course as a university (5072.719) Professor um believe that for certain (5075.199) topics in particular science and (5077.76) medicine and health but other topics as (5079.32) well of course that formal rigorous (5081.28) coursework is by far the best way to (5083.199) learn information for (5085.32) me but that regardless of whether or not (5087.119) you're learning just from YouTube or (5090.159) you're learning from podcasts or you're (5092.08) learning from books you're learning from (5093.6) the school of life as it were from (5095.32) experience that testing as a form of (5097.92) studying is absolutely key and gosh (5100.84) there's such a beautiful body of (5104.4) research in fact I'll link to several (5105.84) studies including a review entitled (5107.28) testing enhances learning a review of (5108.96) the literature as well as a beautiful (5110.8) article test enhanced learning uh which (5113.84) gets into this and there's a wonderful (5116.52) book about this that I'll also provide a (5118.08) link to in the show note captions um all (5119.719) of course authored by researchers who (5122.199) have worked squarely in this field and (5124.679) compare the data on testing as a (5126.28) studying tool to other forms of studying (5127.88) and learning so it's a really impressive (5130.48) literature that I do believe we all (5133.52) should have known about and that's why (5135.56) I'm passing it on to you now now before (5137.32) we wrap up I want to make sure that I (5140.04) emphasize some of the other key (5141.719) components to studying and learning that (5142.96) have nothing to do with testing as a (5145.88) studying (5147.48) tool and those are the role of emotion (5148.679) the role of story and the role of what's (5153.159) called interleaving now in terms of (5157.48) emotion I think we all inherently (5159.32) understand that more emotionally Laden (5161.04) experiences are remembered more durably (5163.719) we tend not to forget them in fact this (5166.52) is the basis of things like PTSD (5168.08) post-traumatic stress disorder it is the (5170.84) reality that one trial learning that is (5173.159) exposure to something and never (5176.36) forgetting it occurs very readily when (5177.96) the thing that we're exposed to is (5181.84) negative or has a very heavy negative (5183.679) emotional Salient so it could be (5187.679) something we read or something we see (5189.04) sometimes it's something that happens to (5191.679) us you know I I don't like the idea of (5193.48) that but this is true your nervous (5195.52) system is wired such neuroplasticity is (5197.76) such that stressful experiences because (5200.96) they deploy such massive amounts of (5205.52) adrenaline epinephrine as well as other (5208.159) neuromodulators allow very quickly for (5211.28) the milu the environment of the neural (5214.6) circuits that led up to that experience (5216.92) to strengthen their connections with one (5219.36) trial so-call one trial learning this is (5221.48) why sadly although at the same time from (5224.199) an Adaptive perspective we say (5227.76) fortunately if you were to step outside (5230.08) today and God forbid see somebody get (5232.48) hit by a (5234.88) car you would remember that chances are (5235.92) you would remember that forever now that (5238.6) does not mean that the emotional (5240.6) components of that memory are (5243.199) necessarily going to stay within you (5245.719) there are tools for the treatment of (5247.36) PTSD such as the different ones that (5250.48) come to mind are you know systematic (5253.239) exposure therapy where you're reexposed (5255.719) to that idea or memory sometimes even (5258.719) circumstance with of course the support (5262.56) of a trained professional typically a (5264.84) psychiatrist or (5266.52) psychologist and the emotional load of (5268.08) that experience is gradually uncoupled (5270.84) from your M Mor of the experience (5273.679) there's things like EMDR there are (5274.96) pharmacologic approaches some of these (5277.119) are combined with the sorts of things (5278.76) I've described I've done entire episodes (5280.08) about stress and PTSD again you can find (5282.28) those at hubman lab.com by putting (5283.92) stress PTSD into the search (5285.4) function however we know that it is the (5288.44) same neuromodulators mainly epinephrine (5292.04) and norepinephrine deployed at massive (5295.04) amounts in those moments where something (5297.08) very stressful happens that allows the (5298.8) neural circuits that led up to the (5300.92) circumstance as well as the neural (5303.119) circuits that encode that visual scene (5304.96) and scenes like it or sounds like it to (5307.159) be locked in and linked to the stress (5310.0) response now what this is really all (5312.28) saying is that negative stuff is (5315.0) remembered typically the first time and (5317.6) every time and very durably over time as (5319.639) compared to positive experiences which (5324.32) as far as Peak experiences go right (5326.32) birth of your first child a wedding a (5328.48) wonderful um professional or person (5331.36) experience those two can be one trial (5334.32) learning and memory but most things that (5336.6) we are exposed to are not at those (5338.92) extremes either negative or (5340.639) positive however we know that any kind (5343.159) of story any kind of emotional emphasis (5346.679) on material either in the delivery of (5349.56) that material but certainly in the way (5351.92) that that material is perceived by you (5354.28) like getting really excited about (5357.0) something you want to learn or thinking (5358.48) something's really awful is likely to be (5360.08) more readily and stably committed to (5363.36) your memory and that's because of these (5365.8) neuromodulators like epinephrine and (5367.6) norepinephrine but other neuromodulators (5369.32) as well that wire those experiences into (5371.119) your neural circuits again these (5373.679) neuromodulators epinephrine (5375.36) norepinephrine we also hear about (5376.679) acetycholine dopamine Etc they can (5377.96) operate at low levels and sort of (5381.32) background levels they can create subtle (5383.36) fluctuations and mood focus and (5387.08) attention or they can create massive (5388.88) shifts in mood focus and attention (5390.96) depending on their levels their time and (5392.6) much much more Point here is that if (5394.4) you're a teacher Andor if you are a (5396.679) learner paying attention to your (5400.199) internal State as you're trying to learn (5402.199) is very key we've all had that teacher (5403.679) that lecture that just kind of drones (5406.92) things out in monotone if you need to (5408.52) learn the material coming out of a (5410.36) source like that person or otherwise (5412.04) you're going to have to ramp up your (5414.28) level of internal attention consciously (5415.6) in order to bring about some emotional (5418.0) salience some intensity to the way it's (5420.119) perceived and you can do that just (5423.4) through your own thinking as opposed to (5424.88) the situation whether you have a super (5428.239) Dynamic teacher who's telling you things (5430.08) with wide eyes and perhaps even cracking (5431.56) jokes by the way the teachers that crack (5433.639) jokes get lower teacher evaluations than (5435.04) those that don't crack jokes or swear (5437.88) did you know that the teachers that (5439.76) crack jokes and swear they're perceived (5441.08) as more likable but they get lower (5443.08) overall evaluations typically they're (5444.6) seen as less professional and therefore (5446.56) less good teachers by their students (5448.96) that's why I try not to make too many (5451.48) jokes or swear in my (5452.719) lectures the point being that we all (5455.119) have those really wonderful Dynamic (5458.84) teachers yes it's much easier to learn (5460.32) and remember that material you still (5463.159) need to test yourself on it but it's (5464.679) much easier to learn that material for (5466.639) the very reasons I say it before it's a (5468.679) lesser example of more deployment of the (5470.639) neuromodulators in you the learner that (5473.32) is exposed to that material okay so (5475.92) emotion matters so much so that in a (5478.56) beautiful review about learning a memory (5481.04) from the Great James maau one of The (5483.199) Luminaries in modern neuroscience and (5484.92) psychology of memory he talked about a (5486.8) medieval practice this is pretty wild (5489.28) whereby people and kids kids are people (5491.88) of course but adults and kids were (5495.36) taught information and then thrown (5497.48) literally thrown into cold water why to (5501.239) deploy adrenaline and consolidate memory (5503.96) of the material they were exposed to now (5506.44) I know we've covered deliberate cold (5508.96) exposure on this podcast before no I'm (5510.719) not saying you need to do a cold plunge (5513.28) after being exposed to new material but (5514.96) guess what they were doing that many (5516.8) hundreds of years ago and it makes sense (5518.679) logically based on all our understanding (5521.239) of the neurobiology underlying things (5524.119) like PTSD underlying emotion Laden (5526.08) memory formation and consolidation and (5529.119) our ability to remember things that were (5532.159) emotionally Laden much better than (5533.92) things that were less emotionally Laden (5535.56) so if you want to take a cold shower (5537.679) after learning some material or even (5539.92) better testing yourself mentally on that (5541.48) material while in a cold shower or cold (5544.08) plunge you certainly can just don't stay (5546.719) in there too long use best practices if (5548.36) you want to know what those best (5551.08) practices are for deliberate cold (5552.159) exposure you can check out our (5553.6) deliberate cold exposure newsletter at (5555.239) huberman lab.com it's completely zero (5556.88) cost you don't even need to sign up you (5558.6) simply go to newsletter in the menu tab (5560.36) and you can find that PDF and now (5562.08) because you are becoming proficient in (5565.08) an understanding of neuroplasticity and (5566.56) learning and testing and neuromodulators (5568.159) like epinephrine yes drinking caffeine (5569.88) will increase your levels of EP nephrine (5572.4) not strikingly so but enough that it (5575.239) probably helps you learn things a little (5578.08) bit better should you drink the coffee (5579.36) after listen that's getting a little bit (5580.719) too down in the details the most (5583.04) important components to learning are (5585.0) that you be alert so that you can attend (5586.719) so you can pay attention to the material (5589.199) you're trying to learn and then testing (5591.32) yourself later and of course the other (5593.0) component which is getting sufficient (5595.52) amounts of great sleep each night and I (5597.28) highly recommend doing nsdr I mentioned (5599.6) Gap effects before those are very very (5602.44) cool I just used another one now and the (5605.199) final tool for studying that I believe (5609.0) is not discuss enough and is a bit (5611.199) counterintuitive so it's a fun one to (5612.76) just mention and that perhaps you can (5614.52) explore in your own studying and (5616.44) learning Adventures is interleaving of (5618.08) information this one's kind of wild (5620.679) actually turns out that if your (5622.8) instructor or you takes information (5626.88) about something that they're trying to (5629.679) teach you or you're trying to learn (5631.239) maybe it's piano know maybe it's (5633.0) Neuroscience maybe it's how to learn (5634.52) better and every once in a while throws (5636.4) in a little anecdote about something (5638.28) let's just say or mention something (5640.719) about the Olympics or incorporate (5643.52) something that seems pseudo random (5647.639) because it's not actually related to the (5649.679) material you're trying to learn turns (5651.56) out that that acts not as a gap in the (5653.8) same sense that Gap effects which are (5656.48) times in which you do nothing in order (5658.32) to get more repetitions of the material (5660.679) you just heard in your hippocampus but (5663.0) rather those breaks of interleaving (5665.199) information not just getting a steady (5667.719) barrage like drinking from a fire hose (5669.719) of new information from start to finish (5671.6) turn out to enhance overall learning (5674.08) ability probably we think at a (5676.56) mechanistic level because the neural (5679.719) circuits are able to generate more (5682.239) repetition similar to Gap effects but (5683.6) actually in a very interesting way also (5686.28) because by injecting other information (5690.32) that seems totally unrelated random or (5693.76) pseudo random it allows the brain areas (5696.48) that are responsible for encoding (5699.44) information to take whatever new (5701.239) information you're learning and to (5703.36) incorporate it with existing knowledge (5705.199) or even distantly related knowledge so (5707.28) does this mean that you should learn (5709.44) math and history in the same lecture (5711.239) well I think that might be a bit (5712.96) overwhelming kind of like drinking from (5714.08) Two Fire hoses here we're talking about (5715.36) interleaving challenging information (5717.28) that's new to you with little anecdotes (5719.32) little bits of information that perhaps (5723.04) are new to you but don't require a lot (5724.679) of challenge which is of course why (5726.119) every once in a while I throw in a (5728.0) little anecdote about my Bulldog or (5729.6) learning neuroanatomy or something of (5731.239) that sort it's not just to provide a (5733.4) break it's to provide examples that are (5735.84) related but not Central to the material (5738.239) that we've been talking about today (5740.199) which is all about how to study and (5741.92) learn optimally okay so I realize that (5743.8) many of you are not students any longer (5747.44) although some of you are but in many (5749.8) ways we are all students we are all (5752.159) constantly being exposed to all sorts of (5754.0) information out in the world and (5755.84) goodness knows um thank goodness we (5757.76) don't remember it all but there is of (5760.08) course information that we would like to (5762.04) remember that we would really like to (5763.76) consolidate in our memory and be able to (5766.36) have some Mastery over earlier I said I (5768.8) would distinguish between unskilled (5771.119) skilled Mastery and virtuosity and I'll (5772.52) do that now unskilled of course means (5774.159) that we have limited understanding let (5776.28) alone um ability to use information (5778.239) skilled typically means we know and can (5780.76) recognize and use information in basic (5782.639) ways or even Advanced ways Mastery (5785.679) typically means that we have you know (5788.4) close to the full depth of knowledge in (5790.52) a given area and that we can use it (5792.159) pretty flexibly and virtuosity at least (5794.04) my definition of virtuosity is where we (5797.159) actually have such Mastery of material (5799.44) that we can use it in ways that we still (5802.92) don't even know how we can use meaning (5805.6) that we can inject elements or we even (5808.679) invite elements of uncertainty and kind (5811.04) of spontaneity into the use of that (5813.36) material here I'm thinking of great (5815.08) musicians I'm thinking of great athletes (5816.52) where they know all the plays they know (5818.44) all the moves it's all scripted into (5820.199) their nervous system and they can deploy (5821.639) those at any time so they have real (5823.04) Mastery but in order to display their (5824.48) incredible abilities their virtuosity (5828.679) they actively invite in The X Factor the (5831.56) uncertainty such that sometimes they (5834.6) find themselves playing their instrument (5836.48) or singing or performing athletically or (5838.44) mathematically or what have you in way (5841.28) that even surprise them and that of (5843.719) course is a lot to expect of ourselves I (5846.28) think most of us would be uh content to (5848.84) have skill and Mastery of the things (5851.84) that we care about and you know should (5854.119) we achieve virtuosity then wonderful but (5856.08) one of the main points of today's (5858.84) discussion was to arm you with an (5860.239) understanding of neuroplasticity in the (5861.88) context of studying and learning to (5864.0) really understand that so much of (5865.84) learning stably and consolidating (5867.4) information over time is to offset the (5870.159) forgetting process (5872.44) and that testing is not just a tool for (5873.96) evaluating our knowledge but rather a (5876.08) tool for evaluating and reinforcing and (5877.84) building our knowledge put differently (5881.0) that testing is an excellent tool if not (5883.28) the best tool for studying and I think (5886.199) that's an important reframe that others (5889.08) have brought about and that I really (5891.159) want to highlight underline and bold (5892.679) face during today's discussion it's one (5894.88) that I certainly wish I had applied more (5897.719) in my educational trajectory and it's (5900.119) one that I plan to deploy further in my (5901.88) seeking out of new knowledge in terms of (5905.119) the podcast and Neuroscience but in (5907.48) other areas of my life as well because (5909.44) from the existing literature and (5911.48) hopefully from the way it was presented (5913.119) to you today you probably realize that (5914.56) it is near infinite if not (5918.04) infinite that we can apply testing as a (5920.52) tool for studying self- testing testing (5923.36) of others using testing as a way to (5925.44) really probe what we know and don't know (5928.199) and to really offset that forgetting (5929.92) process and in that sense it is is (5931.639) really nicely aligned with what we know (5933.8) about (5936.32) neuroplasticity and it's also something (5937.28) that we can use freely and that you can (5939.52) use covertly that you can apply in your (5941.639) own seeking out of knowledge and new (5944.599) skills of all kinds classroom or (5946.76)

I do read (5979.119) all the comments for those of you that (5981.28) haven't heard I have a new book coming (5983.04) out it's my very first book it's (5984.44) entitled protocols an operating manual (5986.52) for the human body this is a book that (5988.8) I've been working on for more than 5 (5990.48) years and that's based on more than 30 (5991.84) years of research and experience and it (5993.76) covers protocols for everything from (5996.44) sleep to exercise to Stress Control (5998.199) protocols related to focus and (6001.639) motivation and of course I provide the (6003.28) scientific substantiation for the (6005.96) protocols that are included the book is (6007.84) now available by pre-sale at protocols (6009.92) book.com there you can find links to (6012.44) various vendors you can pick the one (6014.88) that you like best again the book is (6016.52) called protocols an operating manual for (6018.28) the human body if you're not already (6020.8) following me on on social media I'm (6022.84) hubman lab on all social media platforms (6024.56) so that's Instagram X formerly known as (6027.08) Twitter threads Facebook and Linkedin (6029.28) and on all those platforms I cover (6031.56) science and science related tools some (6033.599) of which overlaps with the content of (6035.44) the hubman Lab podcast but much of which (6036.84) is distinct from the content on the (6038.8) huberman Lab podcast again that's hubman (6040.44) lab on all social media channels if you (6042.76) haven't already subscribed to our neural (6044.96) network newsletter our
